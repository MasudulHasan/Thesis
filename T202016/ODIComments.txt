 
Hello Jarod, Nice article, happy to see apart from praising someone is really speaking against if things are not done properly, Well done.
 
 
My request is if you can write something with regards to the " need of more cricket for associate nations (scotland, ireland, netherland, Afghanistan,..so on ), until unless they are not playing against each other..not playing bi-lateral, triangular series really there are less chances for their improvement.  
 
 
Now ICC have to look for sprite of cricket more rather than money..its time to expand the cricket arena to world level  instead of making 100-200 millionaire cricketers.
 
 
why there are no supporter for those country because people think they will not able to produce good cricket, viewers might not get entertainment but how come you can expect a beginner to perform in High level.
 
 
Really there is a serious need for more cricket to Associate nation, if they start  loosing interest then cricket will be game of only 10-12 nation.

I am excited and so are others. I see many in office looking at the scores every now and then.
And I want Netherlands and Ireland team to qualify but surprised to see Oman and Afghanistan teams playing well.  
There may not be many at the ground for the QUALIFIERS but it will pick up steam moving on. Only wrong I felt was that they should have started the tournament on a weekend so every one could catch the excitement.
So please do consider before writing an article! Thanks!

India is incapable of organizing big tournaments. Always messy

But, Jared, I thought if you build it, they will come?!
 
 
And Nagpur clearly built it.

If the tournament was started in Perth and if the first ball goes over the keeper's head after pitching will there be any crying?? why  should low bounce be blamed? these wickets for a T20 match make it an even contest between ball & bat.  Expecting a crowd for Zim Vs HK match?

It's India's tournament, it's their ball, their bails, their tv rights paying for it.... so why should they worry about anyone else?

when Associates are not included in World Cup for lack of interest they generate, ICC gets the blame for not promoting cricket. When associates get the chance for promoting cricket, ICC gets the blame for lack of interest they generate. hmmm

ICC Cricket acts like the award ceremonies of the old (now too?) in India. Everyone and their brother was on stage to have their time in spotlight. By the time the introductions were done, the TV was switched off and the man of the series did not matter! I mean, what?!!! There is a ranking in place from ICC! It is right there ^ in the 'stats' section! Pick the top ten and go! Vroom vroom! Last Champion vs the Host!  If its too much of a hassle, then you can always begin with Australia vs India.

These are the qualifiers though... How can you expect locals to come and enjoy these matches in huge numbers when there is literally no known players involved (minus the Bangladeshi team of course)

i read all your articles and i loved them....but sorry this is a bad article .how can you except number of fans for just qualifying match..talking about pitch it is not like old one..160-70 were scored..do you think they are less?..i also watched comments no one is agree with you..

Poor article by Jarrod. It came across as snobby to be honest. Dear Jarrod, this ain't the start of the tournament by any means (with all respect to Associate nations, ZIM and BD). The tournament proper begins with the Men in Blue taking on the Black Caps. Plus, Nagpur has produced some fascinating games in the past... so it ain't that bad as you make it out to be. Besides, every ICC qualifying round has had poor crowd turn out in the history of the game. I don't need to go beyond the ICC World Cup held in the Caribbean in 2007. That was a much poorly organized tournament that was nothing more than a yawn fest by the time Australia won it under bad light.

That is never a run out. Embarrassing to suggest it is. Unless you think the player is levitating? This is why cricket has a rapidly diminishing patronage.

Wow these pitches are slow and low dustbowls expected a little more pace being T20 format. Does look a bit strange new ball taken fast bowler and ball dribbles to keeper.

They need to separate out the qualifiers from the main draw. While I understand that logisitically it makes more sense to have them together (like was done even for say the Champions Trophy), it does take the excitement and sheen away from the main tournament. 
 
 
Also, it needs to be marketed properly. Instead of "The ICC World Twenty20 starts today" they should have been honest and mentioned "The ICC World Twenty20 Qualifying Round starts today". 
 
 
The first game for all practical purposes is really on March 15. I expect the excitement for the tournament to start right around that time.

I just found out through this article that world t20 has started and, i'm a regular on cricinfo, but still didn't have a clue. Its India, though, and people will come when its time. What a great write up though. Poetic, amusing, hilarious!

this tournament has started off as the poorest thus far, it really has nothing to be excited about, although it's the qualifiers, it just doesnt have the intensity or vibe that a Caribbean/South African or Australian tournament would have. It honestly looks like warm ups.

I understand the point you are trying to make, Jarrod.  By all reporting, the tournament was poorly organized...both the ICC and BCCI need to take full responsibility for that!  For instance, tickets going on sale at the last moment, not allowing foreign fans sufficient time to make travel arrangements!  At the same time, this "prequalification tournament" for the main draw could hardly be considered the beginning of the World Cup.  The fans are smarter than that!  The ICC once again got the format wrong!  Instead, they should've just included the best four teams to the tournament.  Why does Bangladesh have to qualify?  I have always maintained that as a sporting body they are woefully managed!

Coming from someone who has been a supporter for the Associate countries and frequently plays to the gallery over the number of teams in the World Cup, this is very odd.

We know how much crowd comes in England even for big games. And we know how Aus organized the last world cup with inconsequential games and empty stadiums.

Jarrod's article has merit. Organizing a world cup with few hundreds spectators on inauguration day is a fault. No excuse.
Locals like to see only their national squad? Poor sentence: if India ever has the chance to organize a FIFA world cup, stands would be fully packed for every match, you would see Indians queueing up in dozens of thousands to assist Camerun vs. Bolivia.
I read that tickets fetched prices from 200 R to 10.000 R. I think no one bought a 10.000R ticket for Afghanistan-Scotland. Is it difficult to sell FIRSTLY 50R tickets up to a 50% stands occupancy rate and only THEN premium tickets? If applied, we would ALWAYS have several thousands people on the stands and more revenues: although the Indian organization is unable to understand it, it's better to sell 20.000 tickets at 50R (which is feasible in a half day regardless which nations playing) rather than 1 or two at 10.000R.

Well, it is just a qualifier what did he expect? a packed stadium with the fans on their toes??. Come on!. They are just getting ready for the big stage! They are not there yet!. Fans will be interested and give them the limelight once they make it to the tournament!

Well. You made too much out of it. That was well expected, and most people know that this is not that start of tournament, start will be when India plays NZ.  This first part is just made to look like that part but it is not. So don't exaggerate.

What's wrong with the tried and true format of 4 groups of 4 teams? ICC are seriously not up to standard. The 2019 ODI World Cup will show how badly they've messed up when 10 teams play a snore-fest.

Have to disagree with one of the best writer of this site - one cos, he is incorrect in considering this to be "start of the tournament" and two cos, it is a bit exaggerated perception about the facility. I'd like to remind my friend that it is the "qualifier" for the tournament and not the actual tournament for which he can see what he expects - huge crowd, excitement and good contests. To make him understand better, all the qualifying matches over the years have drawn little or no attention due to less known teams, unfair contests when one associate is totally raw compared to a better equipped associate and very few cricketing brilliance happening. The ground needs to be appreciated for the way it looked - you can compare the test match played here last and now - the outfield, interiors and overall looks more presentable. Coming to all important 22 yards, it was good enough for the match with good bounce and carry. I don't see scores of 155, 144, 170 otherwise on a pitch you quote!

How can you call Nagpur as one of the bad pitch based on one match. Forgot about IndVsSa WC match here? This is a qualifier round dude. The main event is yet to start. And obviously no matter what you do, people don't watch which they are not interested in. You won't have the same article once the main event starts.

Mr.Kimber - What do you expect? That ICC needs to support only cricket that fills the stadiums? If they had the kind of attitude that you have, we would never have had a Sri Lanka or a Bangladesh today. Minnows need their opportunities no matter what. There are other matches to make money on. This is an investment.

Mr. Mautam... I too am from India and have been staying in Singapore for the last 9 years. I find it difficult to accept your theories. For a start, yesterday, my son, watched the entire match live on Television, so you see, once a cricket fan, always a cricket fan. You are talking about Indian fans not  being able to see beyond Indian players, obviously you've never heard of the IPL. During the last SA tour, every time that AB came out to bat, there were huge cheers of AB, AB for him. Little knowledge is always dangerous!

World T20 should have 4 groups of 4, followed by Quarter-finals, Semi-finals and Final. Will be only 31 matches and that format perfectly suits T20 cricket
 
 
For the ODI world cup, have 14 or 16 teams in 2 groups of 7 or 8, followed by knockouts

"Pre tournament tournaments" no matter what the sport fail to deliver big crowds.
Baseball pre season is ongoing. Cactus and Grapefruit leagues are on-going. All the major players, in the sun, in decent sized stadiums, with entrance fees of just a couple of bucks. A part of the year that many Yanks have waited 5 months for.
 
 
Playing in front of maybe 200 people. And these are the multi million a year superstars we are talking about here. Can hardly pull enough to fill a decent bus queue. "Pre tournament tournaments" no matter what the sport fail to deliver big crowds.

The match was more exciting that what Mr Kimber felt. Nagpur is one of the newer and better cricket grounds in India. It is difficult for people in Indian to feel excited about watching a cricket match involving teams like Zimbabwe and Hongkong. Nagpur regularly hosts international matches and only matches involving India draw crowds there. 2011 world cup had seen India vs South Africa match and that match was a sell out. In contrast, the match between New Zealand and Australia had poor attendance. I incidentally had watched both the matches at the ground.
 
 
More people follow the match on TV than on ground. I do not think that a match like this can draw crowds. Such matches need to be hosted in smaller places, viz Patna, etc if one must bring crowds to the ground. That is for ICC to decide.

2007 group format was great, providing scope for upsets, but instead of super 8s should have had QFs. The same could have been done here. As mentioned in an earlier post, football WC format should be adopted, 2-3 group matches then direct into knock outs, rather than playing out further super 8, 6, 4s.

There'll be zero interest in this in Australia for two reasons 1. Footy season has kicked off and 2. It's 20/20. No one here really cares about 20/20

I followed every ball of both opening matches, and was very excited personally.  I wish that they used this format for the ODI World Cup too.  More exciting matches, and leave the main draw with teams that are better.  Top 8 by rankings get automatic entry, and ranks 9-16 get to play a qualifying spot for the last 2 spots.  That's the way to do it.  I found it very exciting.  Hong Kong were in front until Chigumbura started hitting 6s, and they nearly came back towards the end of their innings.  Scotland were way in front of Afghanistan early in their chase, before they lost wickets, and never recovered.  They were both good matches.  I totally disagree with the idea that this was bad for cricket.  People who love cricket will watch them.  People who only love the top sides will wait.  It is perfect.

Hate to disagree with Jarrod, but I thought the game was OK.  maybe it was just that I was reading it on cricinfo, in which case well done the commentators.  Or maybe it was just a game of CRICKET, in which case well done that sport!!  
 
 
If HK had been a little bit tighter in the last couple of overs, or their middle order been just a little bit more productive, or their closers just a little bit more adventurous, it would probably have been a great finish.  There will almost certainly be duller games in the tournament, even among the top tier.
 
 
But yes, the qualifying should be done at another time and place.

@MAUTAN - That is a snobbish attitude. You have been out of india for 20yrs, then on what basis you can talk about india? You don't become cricket fans by watching zimbabwe playing hongkong! Lots of people in india have better things to do in life. They follow scores on cricinfo, or catch a couple of overs of the game when they are home in front of the TV. That does not mean they are less knowledgeable, they are normal people with priorities in life like job, kids, wife etc. 
 
 
Stop judging other people and what they do. Lots of cricket fans know a lot more about cricket than you!

The Qualifiers are staged poorly. Surely can't be right to have just before the main event starts. The whole format doesn't seem right either. If the ICC were keen to have more matches amongst the Test Nations, they were much better of with the 2007 ODIs format, 4 groups of 4 teams with 2 teams from each group progressing to Super 8s. This format provides a better platform to the Associate Nations with every match having greater meaning in the context of the game. Secondly, it would also ensure enough number of matches amongst the major nations to meet the commercial needs. we know ICC is vary of this format as a result of what happened to India and Pak at the 2007 ODI WC and how it badly impacted the event.   The truth is there were alot of things wrong with that WC but the format wasn't one aongst them. It was poorly implemented with too many rest days and very drawn out process. This format, if implemented properly can work very well and not only meet the demands of various stakeholders but can be sustained for many World Cups to come for both ODIs and T20s.

I don't understand this balance between bat and ball thing. In recently concluded NZ v AUS test series, NZ didn't play a spinner in one of the matches. How is it balanced. In AUS also pitches are so flat that everybody is scoring hundred. In our last series with India it was the bowlers who were having a laugh. In Asia cup apart from Ashwin who is class apart, all the other spinners were pummeled.

This is an administration failure. In order to promote associate teams ICC should have made it free at least in the gallery, giving ample advertisements to that fact so that it be not deemed discriminatory to the teams. Its good to see Mr. Kimber that you are passionate about the game and wanted to see it being viewed by more than the motley. The ICC hasn't done their homework properly.

The pitch was ok. There was little turn. Low bounce. Why is that people from outside India want bounce like england or australia ? This is India. I hear far too many people calling for uniformity in pitches across the globe. I have nothing against them. Its just that we will end up with flat batting tracks everywhere. Just like how Australia is turning out to be. after all, its a batsmen's world.

Just look at the ticket pricing. Starts from INR 200 to INR 10,000. Does BBCI or ICC expect somebody to watch Associate teams play at this price? Had they kept the price nominal or for that matter free, you would see lots of people coming in and enjoy these matches. Having full stadium with smaller earnings is way better than empty stadium with same smaller earnings.

Reminds me of the 2010 Commonwealth games in India, Empty arenas and stands for all sports unless and Indian was a certainty for a Gold Medal. It makes for an awful viewing when you have top athletes in the world and nobody comes to watch. Granted these two teams are not top echelon but something should still be done to get bums on seats.

I don't think Mr Kimber is saying anything against India per se. This is more against the  ICC which has always acted like a foster parent when it comes to associate nations. If you consider this qualifier stage a part of the 'actual' tournament (which am sure ICC and BCCI will leave no stone unturned to make a success) then we have 16 teams which I think make a perfect setup for four groups leading up to a knock out stage starting from quarters. But because that will increase chances of upsets and increasing the possibility of some major teams not reaching the knockouts ICC is shying away from it. Maybe scars of 2007's 50 over WC have not healed completely but that tournament had also a lot to do with ticketing prices. Personally I feel a 32 team tournament a-la football WC style can make a cracker of a tournament if promoted well.

This article has not been thought out well. The reason why such drabness was there is because only the Associate nations are playing now, wait for the 'big-boys' to start playing and then see, you might not even get a ticket for the matches!

I usually love Jarrod..but I think he's taken the cribbing too far this time...I mean seriously...what was he expecting before the match? A rip roaring contest with baying crowds??? Cannot blame anyone here!

RKRISHI One of these 'unknown' teams has defeated India quite a few times across formats

Just because of one square-turning pitch, the Nagpur pitch becomes "always had the reputation to be poor"? Infact, Nagpur has always been an exciting limited overs' destination.
 
 
And this was a qualifier-match for heaven's sake. And yes, the ticketing system sucked, but only for the India matches, it was a normal queue-ticketing system for the other matches.

Brilliant article! Never laughed so much after reading an article on Cricinfo. One can safely assume that the article was far more entertaining than the match it covered!

Nice points but you are not properly informed. Since , you are living in Canada , you might not have proper information on few points about Indians. Let me correct you on a few points sir. hero worship is every where in world. Do you know a certain nation Brazil where footballers are worshipped. How many times have you seen a India- England ( prior world cup 2015 there was a tri series ) game in Australia full of crowd. Never. Reason - Most Australians will have no interest in a game not featuring Australia. Indians are bound to follow ONLY INDIA games . Why would we waste money by watching other games. It is same all over. So , do not make it only Indians do not follow sir. I have seem thousands of people watch cricket games of all nations on television and are better informed than many all over the world.  Since West Indies is near your home , let me tell you that world cup 2007 was a failure while 2011 was a huge success. That involved many other team games.

Mr. Kimber,   do you really think if this match was organised in a place like Lords there would have been more crowd ? This is a qualifier match for gods sake between unkown teams., What do you expect ?

totally agreed...ICC should learn from FIFA who do the fantastic job always. why ICC scheduled qualifier before the WC, it should been last year and it should been qualifier`s home ground instead in host WC Nation. now nobody is caring about the qualifier matched and there is no crowd. is it really WC???? shame on ICC ...shame on you..

BCCI and ICC missed out the venue where people eould anyways watching the match. Chennai has the reputation of 'knowledgeable crowd' and i'm sure if qualifiers had held at Chennai, the stadium would be atleast half-packed.

First match must be with atleast one major team!

@ MAUTAN - agreed with you when you say "Nobody cares at all about any other team..". And that's why 9 out of 10 Indian fans never acknowledge other teams' talent. Whether India wins or loses, its always about India. Its like this... when India wins, its because of India's talent. But if India loses, it is because Dhoni should have batted first or bowled first, blaming the loss of toss, Yuvraj should have scored faster, Ishant Sharma gave away easy runs, the pitch deteriorated (as if otherwise India would have scored 400 runs in 20 overs!), OR the opponents won by fluke, i.e. Chandimal just slogged and somehow he clicked, if only Australia won in Indian pitches they will be accepted as talented, England is a one-time wonder, etc., etc. I have found most Indian fans to be very unsporting. Pathetic really. When you win, celebrate; when you lose, accept gracefully that your opponents are also talented and deserve to win.

What an inauspicious start to the tournament. Empty stands, a lifeless pitch, and after every boundary the same EDM clip blaring into an otherwise silent ground. It was hard to watch. Hard not to feel bad for the players and fans who had to experience this disaster of cricket administration. The ICC and BCCI should be ashamed.

I think this is a very unfair representation of the effort put in by some hard working players..  I agree that the crowds were disappointing but that is to be expected for a match that does not feature the top tier teams... That does not mean that the world 'wanted this match to stop'

Ok..I am originally from India, played and watched cricket my whole life, even at representative levels. I am been saying this to whoever cares, that India by and large are not a cricket fanatic country. At the most, a very tiny population cares about the Indian team. Nobody cares at all about any other team..let alone the associates. True cricket fans Jarrod, are like you and me, who love cricket more than any team per se...What happens is, that tiny population of cricket fans, translates into a few million and that is where the marketing hype is about India being cricket mad. I am in Canada for the last 19 years and at the most I have met 2-3 Indians who watch cricket regularly, and that too mostly Indian matches. It goes up a bit for World cups. So..the truth is India does not care about cricket in general and neither are people that interested. There is more hero and celeb worship, even when people go and watch a game..rather than talking about finer points of the game.

Great article by Jarrod as usual.... expressive ..... and to best utilize the associates is to make the tournament 16 teams with four groups n then straight quarter finals... but i dnt think icc will let it happen cuz they just think about commercialization and it wont b prompted if one of the big teams gets ousted

@TAP, he has been the classiest for over a decade now. Sadly his returns have been miserable though. But maybe he can reward his many fans with a wonderful 3 years of international cricket to lend respectability to his career.
