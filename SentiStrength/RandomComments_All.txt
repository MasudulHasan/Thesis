Is this already done in the LCD code? Maybe not...					
"There are two RPC calls to be made to download artifacts |download| and |wait_for_status|. Sync means that you can use that artifact after |download| has returned. Async means that you must wait until |wait_for_status| has returned. This is done so that we can start kicking off a suite run before we fully finish downloading everything we might need.

The |download| call happens as part of the RPC call that's made to autotest to kick off a suite. The |wait_for_status| RPC call is made as part of dynamic_suite code (see dynamic_suite.py:450). By the time you'd be kicking off your firmware test it would be assured that the firmware tarball would be downloaded. Therefore, I would think it should be fine/safe to make this async."					
"Patch Set 2:

I would suggest two commits. The first one is just the import without and mods. The second is a git mv of the ebuild file to the -r1 name and enabling the patch. This is done so that we retain history of pristine upstream ebuild and then successive changes to them locally.  So in this commit just pull in the upstream ebuild  as is, and a follow on with the modification. 

Thanks"

"The variable you should probably use here is U_BOOT_FDT_USE, defined in make.conf.

"Patch Set 1:

These are used in decoding also, so yes they should obviously be enabled when possible. Alternatively, someone should rewrite all this in intrinsics and verify it's not slower.

x86inc.asm works when:
(A) we're 64bit
(B) we're 32bit, but pic is disabled
(C) we're 32bit, pic is enabled, but the final binary is linked with -mdynamic-no-pic (or a non-gcc equivalent).

x86inc.asm doesn't work when:
(D) we're 32bit, pic is enabled, and the final binary does not use -mdynamic-no-pic or a non-gcc equivalent during linking

My understanding is that Chrome on win32 does (C) (i.e. the windows/msvc linker does gcc's -mdynamic-no-pic behaviour by default), so there's definitely an argument to be made for keeping these assembly optimizations."

That's right, you only need to land the 9999 now. (Actually it's been supported since at least Oct 2010, but yeah there used to be a bug)"

"Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(2 inline comments)

I don't see the need for this change. If you built with the ebuild unmodified, you'd get an image.bin which would be what you want. As far as I could tell looking at the new function, it's identical to the old one except that you're leaving out the original image.bin.

The difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the --force-rw option in one case and not in the other. What that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesn't allow the RO only optimization even if the RO firmware claims it supports it.

The RO only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of RO instead of jumping into an RW copy partway through. If you really don't want to enable that optimization, you can not pass that flag to vboot when running VbInit.

Even if you do want to split things out like this, it would be better to take the existing depthcharge function and to selectively build the RO image based on a use flag.


Independent of whether splitting things up is a good idea, if Mike (who knows bash much better than I do, I think) likes the style of the new function you've made, it would be nice to incorporate the style changes back into the original function."

"Ah.  Yes, the test_wait_for_sleep() method implicitly assumes
that sleep has already been triggered, but that won't be true if

At any rate, looking at test_wait_for_sleep() and

life is to hard code the timeout, and raise TestFail, neither of
which you want.

So...  the right answer would seem to be to rename
_ping_wait_down() to drop the leading '_', and just call it a
public function.

Also, the hard-coded timeouts here need names, and some
justification for their length."

"OK here are my thoughts:

The error handling is fine, but the message doesn't mention bootstage so it isn't clear where the failure is. I think you should fix that.

set_bootstage_prop is called twice with the same path. In both cases it calls fdt_path_offset() to get the offset. You may as well just call it once here, immediately after your strncat below.

Then you set_bootstage_prop can be passed a node. In fact this function just has a call to fdt_setprop() so why have it at all? Just call fdt_setprop_cell or fdt_setprop_string instead, which are better suited to your requirements anyway

Re working_fdt, I do prefer a single reference to a global rather than multiple spread throughout the file, but if you remove the function then this is not an issue anyway, I think that the whole of this for() loop should be in a separate function called from bootstage_report() if working_fdt is not 0.

"Patch Set 4:

Although already merged, I don't think this is the right solution. 

Currently the behavior of the permissions system (TCEmain and thus also all other components) is to use ""checkLanguageAccess"" only if the TCA for the table has a ""languageField"".

""pages"" is not such a table, because there is ""pages_language_overlay"". So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the ""Original Language"" is to remove the permissions for editing table ""pages"" and only allow ""pages_language_overlay"". See also http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27794

This is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess.

Similar problem we have in the ""List view"", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more ""aggressive"" than in the GUI.

Correct solution for this particular fix would be to check if user has ""edit permissions"" on the ""pages"" table - just like TCEmain also does.

As this is confusing for integrators in general, I would rather propose that someone thinks about a better approach on ""language restriction permissions on pages"" in the first place before fixing the GUI.

I am undecided still if we should revert this merge, but I am currently pretty sure we should not backport that to 4.5.
