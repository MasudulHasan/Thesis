Definitely not a winning combo. Just a bat second winner. When batting first this team will again struggle. Lose two wickets inside powerplay, eat up as many deliveries you can and then hope for some tailender onslaught to get to a 140 score and then lose the match comfortably saying we didn't bat well. There should be a plan for every Four overs of the match. Guptill can be a maxwell but tough to accommodate unless you bring in nathu singh for southee or mitch." 	3	-2
2 overseas bowlers/5 specialist bowlers is a very good approach for MI as McClenhagen and Southee can hit few sixes too if required and also Harbhajan which leaves them with 10 six hitters in the team out off 11 (except Bumrah).' 	3	-1

Baffling. Why play Southee and Mc in the same XI. The conditions in which they deserve their respective place in the team are mutually exclusive. It's highly likely that Parthiv is playing largely because of his keeping, given Buttler is dubious while keeping to spin. Otherwise, bringing in some more power in place of Parthiv, viz Nitesh Rana might be useful. MI should drop one of the foreign pacers and bring in Corey Anderson.  In this tournament, given chasing teams are doing substantially better, it would make sense to beef up the batting, given anything under-200 is a bad goal. Better for a side like MI to stock up well on batting and go gung-ho from ball one. Parthiv, Rohit, Rayudu, Buttler, Anderson, Pollard, Hardik, Krunal, Bhajji, Southee/Mitch, Bumrah. 	3	-2

@DEBKOB: at the end of the day, the chap has won 3 IPL titles - 2 as captain (one after his team was 0-4 at the start) - where his leadership and batting was one of the critical factors. That's what counts at the end of the day, dew or no dew!!" 	2	-2
@NEEDGREENPITCHES4BOWLINGALLROUNDERS: I kind of agree with Anand Palwankar that Rohit is the better (or more 'level-headed') captain than Virat, at least in T20s. Getting your team to the playoffs after starting the season with 0-5 (2014) and winning the title after 0-4 (2015) is by no small means because of Rohit's leadership. Starc is out this season, but he played for RCB two seasons prior to that. How many times did RCB win the title then?" 	2	-1

(remember his test scores vs WI were w/o WI test destructive players)" 	2	-1
@Anand Palwankar by your argument Gambhir would be best of lot . He is even capable and consistent opener and plays most of his home games on sluggish Kolkata pitch when compared to both Rohit and Virat who play in batting paradises :). Having a good bowling attack is a liberty to captain and helps him solve bowling problem easily. Gambhir has best bowling attack of the 3. Rohit has best bowling attack compared to Virat. There is no way Rohit's captaincy can be measured against Virat with bowling attack he is carrying. Starc n Badree out of IPL . RCB is going to blow lot of high scoring games cos of class of bowling. There main weapon in bowling is retired allrounder Watson who was never a spearhead. Rohit has 2 new zealanders and Bhajji who can be handful based on conditions. Death overs and powerplay overs and middle overs are in cruise control for Rohit /MI think tank. RCB fails in that regard year after year so does captaincy and rotation of bowlers." 	2	-3

I agree with sudimagge. Except for one game, all teams batting second seem to be winning the match. As soon as someone loses the toss, that teams lost the game. Don't even need to watch the whole match. Just for the meaningless slog-fest that don't make a tad bit if difference in the end. And how disappointing the RCB with its star-studded cast seems to be at the moment. Please improve pitches where the toss doesn't decide the fate of the team." 	2	-2
Again and again it's prooving Rohit is a best leadership qualities than Virat. People always making mistake to understand difference between a good player and a good leader. Today Virat riding on everything due to his big batting abilities. But when particular time comes when your leadership qualities are tested, Virat always fumbles. There are so many examples in past we have seen, it's not nessessory that good batsman should be a good leader. We saw Mike Briarly, Clive Lloyd, Ian Chapple etc etc... Vivian Richard, Ian Botham were couldnt do much as a leader. Virat is the best batsman we have after Sachin. But since last few years we are watching Rohit is doing much better as a leader than Virat. Last both IPL titles for MI had big impact of Rohits leadership. Remember last years last league match of MI against KKR. Rohit brought Pollard in last over and proved master strok. Yesterday when Rohit was taking RCB bowlers, frustration was clearly seen on Virats face. Rohit..better leader." 	2	-3

Under pressure, Virat loses his cool as a captain. His bowling changes, field settings go awry the moment there's a counter punch from the opposition. A wicket where faster bowlers go for runs, picking Aaron makes little sense, especially when Aaron is not known to be a thinking bowler.  Sreenath Arvind, who has a great strike rate should be an automatic choice. In the absence of Gayle, Watson should open as he has seen a lot of success earlier in that position." 	3	-2

We do not have to watch the full match to know the result, the toss it self will decide. captains who are unlucky to loose the toss, god help them, and also the bowlers who will be bowling in the second half of the match..all the so called experts giving opinion on them, in a situation where everyone knows that the team batting second will win at all cost and that too some times easily chasing down , what earlier was a good score, with overs to spare. @BCCI, @ IPL management, please do something about the situation, we are loosing interest since there is no longer a fight to finish in this IPL, it has all the way been win toss, bowl first, win match....' 	2	-3

Pathetic bowling and team selection.  Aaron in the team is a liability. His 19 run over provided the momentum for the MI . aaron and patel should be out . Looks like even if we include 8 bowlers we will not win.  We still havent played RPSG and GL . What  do donald and vettori discuss with bowlers ?  We don have bowlers who can pick wickets in first 6 overs and this has been true for all seasons .  Such worst team management who only concentrate on only batting and dont think anything .  Picking binny and not using his bowling is not accepatable . Kohli field placements are also awful . Even every miss hit were going to vacant boudary line.' 	2	-4

Pollard and Buttler, about 4 or 5 year ago combined in the Somerset T20 team to be one of the most feared batting partnerships in England, Somerset seemed to get to a final every year, and these two invented the cool as ice impossible total chase down before it became a norm, at least in county cricket. Nice to see them together again.' 	2	-3
Fewer comments....reason I feel is nobody supports any one team as there are so many fmgois players spread across. Comments appear when you have a favourite team. Emotions flow from fans for a win or loss. In Leagues, loyalty of fans shifts' 	2	-3
Looks like this is the final eleven and   certainly  the best batting order for MI at least for a few matches.Though I would like to see Guptil and /or Corey at some point, it looks very unlikely considering the restrictions on the number of foreign players.From the beginning I felt Rayudu was the best choice for number three position. He may not be as stylish as Rohit or Virat,but certainly a very good accumulator of runs.Only Butler can come in his place depending on the situation.Good luck MI.' 	3	-2
I think the game got away from RCB at the 5 over mark where Kohli bowled Aaron an extra over which gave away 19 runs. These days as a captain you have to make batsmen guessing by changing bowlers otherwise they set up for the bowler and whack him to all parts. Binny is an excellent out-swinger of the ball and previous season's RR used him most in the Powerplays when ball did a bit." 	4	-2

Fall of one and rise of another seem fit to describe Pandya brothers. Hardik was drafted into the side not long ago with all sorts of comarisons to good current day allrounders, documentaries aired about his fairy tale of finding the pinnacle and limelight, influential binny was sent home but Hardik has lost his aroma too fast. On the other hand his brother looks a much better prospect both with the bat and the ball. Bumrah continues to impress and I hope he will be given an opportunity to perform outside India and pitches will not made placid to support indian batsmen. I am sure Gambhir will make his way to indian side again to add experience on the back of this IPL season. He seems to be more motivated by the downfall of Dhawan.' 	3	-2
Ponting genius shines through again. Guptill not playing may have initially had a few people second guessing the decision, but the investment in Pollard comes good. Looks like a settled MI line-up has both Buttler and Pollard so if Guptill wants it, he must push out either Southee or McClenaghan. For Andersons sake i hope MI release him at the end of the year so he can get a gig with a side that would actually benefit from having him' 	3	-2

Mumbai is the strongest team. I m a KKR supporter. RCB, Gujrat are also very strong. MI found the winning formula.. 1) pick a two of very good indian batsmen (Rohit, Raydu). 2) pick a couple of high SR, high average foreign bats (Pollard, Butler). 3) pick an indian spin bowling allrounder (Krunal) 4) Couple of great foriegn pacers (they also bat well) 5) An indian spinner (Harbhajan).  Gujrat did almost the same thing, but they have foreign allrounders as well. KKR's formula of mystery bowler, foreign quick, two foreign allrounders is not bad... bt batting looks thin when KKR has to chase 170 /" 	3	-2
Great win for MI, but I'm concerned how much of an impact winning the toss is having on these games. Funny enough that MI has lost both games in which they lost the toss while winning 2/3 on winning the toss (that one loss only because Rohit rather bizarrely chose to bat first)." 	3	-3

I was beginning to think Rohit Sharma had lost the ability to bat a decent innings but this captains knock is a timely reminder, of what a very good quality opening batsmen Rohit Sharma is. India should look to play Manish Pandey and Rohit Sharma as Indian openers in international T20 and ODI cricket, Shikhar Dhawan recent form has not been good or show signs of improvement and he is 30. Rohit Sharma had a very mediocre World T20 and i'm sure, other people felt he was loosing the plot as a T20 opener, especially given his last Mumbai Indian innings against Rising Pune Supergiants combined with the form he showed in the recent WT20 tournament." 	3	-3

I have seen Nathu Singh in domestic cricket.Sorry to say but seems highly overrated. Hardly crossed 135 kph.Would be cannon fodder at this level. One of those guys hyped by the media.Nothing in him really and has a really poor body language to go with that.Though would be pleasantly surprised if he can prove me wrong' 	3	-3
Phenomenal performance by Mumbai. However, there's still a good scope of improvement in the eleven. Anderson can come in for Polly since he isn't any handy with his bowling and batting these days. Anderson can bowl well and bats better. Mitch McClenaghan and Jos should stay in the 11 and bring in Guppy for Southee. Rotate Indian bowlers per their performance keeping Bumrah and Bhajji intact." 	2	-1

KKR needs Narine in old form if they are to win the title. Russel and Narine should be must, not sure about Hasting in long run as I feel he has been a pretty ordinary quick for Aus, although he has been good for kkr so far. Sakib's inability to power hit is his weak link, Monru is kinda hit and miss player, Hogg as we saw before brilliant in one game and ordinary in another. Among the foreign only Russle looks reliable atm, they badly need Narin the old X factor." 	3	-2

Rohit good for IPL nothing else, where did you go when INDIA played Pakistan in the same venue .' 	2	-1
Rohit sharmas innings was actually slow in the middle overs and it was only butlers hits that gave MI the impetus and reduced the deficit between balls left and runs required, which brought MI close. Rohit then hit a few fours right at the end and improved his strike rate. So butler was the man largely responsible for MI victory. This is not something new about Rohit but people miss it often. Amongst others, parthiv patel just doesnt fit in. A score of 23 off 20 balls does not augur well for MI if they play him in other matches. Even pandya has been far from impressive and hasnt shown the form he showed on his debut. It is only the foreign players who seem to be capable of winning matches. I hope MI select some good indian players in future editions of IPL and promote local talent instead of parthiv patel.' 	3	-2
Why Shakib Al Hasan is in side bench?' 	1	-2
MI has won today but still it's not a perfect XI.I have a doubt on the utility of Pandya, after seeing him in the WC T20 &amp; first 2 matches in IPL. Also Pollard is completely out of touch after a long injury. My playing XI will be - Rohit ,Parthiv, Guptil,Butler, Anderson, Rayudu, Harbhajan, Shreyas Gopal, Mcleghanan, Bumrah, Nathu Singh." 	2	-2

T20's heavily depend upon toss winning and it's quite unfair to have the toss each time. They can change the rules in a way that each team or pair or other means can decide alternatively and only first time it can be via toss. As an example between India and Australia, have the toss first time, let's say India wins the toss. Second time Australia decide whether to bat/field, then India and son on... They can decide the pairing based upon various factors. That way we more dependent on talent than fortune." 	2	-2

Suddenly KKR seems they can't go the distance.  Only team with big hitters are going to make unless the pitch misbehaves.  KKR does not have one.  The other night RCB was brilliant with the bat, even young Khan was terrific.  While Gambhir scores those 30s and 50s consistently, cannot win matches.  His partner Uthappa cannot score against quality bowling which has been proved time and again.  Seems they have missed the trick this season.  T20 keeps evolving and of late, it is the big hitters who are making impact and KKL does not have one (don't consider Yusuf as one he is out of this league)" 	4	-2

KKR is in for a long season. I am afraid they do not have enough. They had to let Narine and Ghamvir go and get one of the top players (like Watson, Butler, Mustafiz, Jordan, Amir). Other teams are improving, only reason KKR was a threat was Narine and (Russel as an allrounder). While they have a few good desi batsmen (specially Manish), their top paid players Ghamvir and Narine are not going to be enough. MI's top players like Rohit, Butler, Bumrah, Mcclenghan, Harbhajan played well. These guys(except Harbhajan) are the better players of their national team. Sakib's bowling is no longer as threatening as it used to be(Tamim, MohmadUllah, Shabbir, Taskin, Mustafiz, AlAmin are Bangladesh's top players these days). It was such an easy decision to leave Ghamvir and pick him up again and run for Watson. Then bring in one of the top bowlers of WC (Mustafiz, Amir, Jordan). That would do for KKR. They did not do it." 	2	-4
Lovely to see Buttler make his first good contribution. More and bigger ones to follow, with any luck.' 	3	-1
KKR need their bowling duo Shakib and Naraine in place of Munro and Hogg respectively if they want to have a better impact on the remaining matches. No place to experiment a lot!' 	3	-2
Good win for Mumbai. Rohit always superb in Eden. Butler played equally important role. What a player he is. But the best part of this match for me was  chawla gets thrashed by mcclenaghan.' 	2	-2
At one stage what looks like a score of 200 plus ended up scoring 187. Thanks to Gambhir. If a batsman who opens an inning and cannot score at the rate of 2 runs/per ball after he plays 35 balls should give away his wicket and let the others to the power hitting.' 	2	-1
On a pitch which has anything in it for bowlers Rohit is a walking wicket but on a flat pitch like this he will be in my team before even Kohli. Is quite a bit like Martin Guptill honestly.This Is not a criticism as Dhawan can't bat on any surface nowadays. He is over the hill and has peaked and cannot perform at this level.India should discard Dhawan.KKR has serious thinking to do because of they can't afford passengers like Yusuf who are soo way past their sell by date that it's hard to fathom they are playing at this level. Narine/Shakib had to be on this pitch. Gambhir also batting slow but at least he is batting unlike Dhawan who cannot last more than 3-4 overs in any format now. Also soon I think SL will be pushed out of full membership and will play with associates. There are more BD players than SL players this season. Embarrassing times for SL team and all over the hill players getting found out at this level." 	2	-3
Nice going Mcclenaghan! Ideally shouldn't he have won the man of the match award? 2/25 where everyone went for more than 10 an over and then striking 20 of 8? Anyways nice to see Kiwi Lads doing well." 	2	-1
MI just needs to to stick with this team with the exception of Southee and suchith. Corey &amp; Nathu Singh should come in.' 	1	-1
This is not the first time Bumrah has dropped a sitter.  He blew a few in the WC, notably the one against BD.  He is a clumsy ground fielder too. If having Jonty Rhodes as your fielding coach doesn't help you become a better fielder, there are very few other miracles left to save you from regular humiliation in the feild.  I can see him juggle, slip and drop a few semifinals/finals for India through his butterfingers." 	2	-4
Well done Mumbai Indians (Rohit* and Buttler) !!! KKR made a huge blunder leaving out Sunil Narine and Shakib Al Hassan. Mind you, Mumbai have many right handers and Shakib could have made a difference. Anyway, KKR will now surely change their team for next game and that's good for the tournament. We will get to see all players in action and that can only be exciting." 	3	-2
I do not get why KKR is benching Shakib. Is he injured? He is a better bowler than Hoggy was even in Hogg's prime. He is a better batsman than Munro. And quite an adept fielder. And then they are ignoring Chris Lynn, the best batsman of the BBL." 	2	-2
Russel gave 15 runs more in bowling than  he scored in batting. And that decided the match. Sakib  should have played.' 	1	-1
Well played MI and well played Rohit Sharma. Gambhir should have scored faster than 64 off 52. Rohit scored almost 20 runs more  off the same numberof balls.' 	1	-1
Poor selection by KKR, TOOTHLESS bowling. Brad Hogg playing a good match doesnt mean he will win you all matches and play like that whole season. After all, he is an old player, WAY past his prime form. Leaving out Shakib, Narine while taking in Hastings, Hogg, Russel, was a POOR choice.' 	2	-2
This current xi wont bring trophy.' 	1	-1
Narine must be given a chance to see if his bowling has that juice anymore while Shakib (Batting   Bowling ) must play instead of one of Hastings(bowling), Hogg(bowling), Russel(bowl bat). Maybe Morkel could be tried too' 	1	-2

I think it is better to replace Dhawan with Rahane to open with Rohit. I hope Ro will be in good form in his home ground. As far as Yuvi's replacement is concerned I think it is better to go with Pandey who is known for his batting skill. We need more runs if we are batting first and we need the same if we are chasing." 	3	-2
About Dhawan, "Since then, he has made 1, 6, 23 and 13. He hasn\'t looked out of touch, and has timed the ball brilliantly at times". How many brilliant shots could he have hit in those 43 runs in 4 innings, two of which are only 1 and 6. I have said before, Dhawan scores one innings of some substance once every 10-12 innings. So, his next big one will come after another 5-6 innings from now. Ind should bring Rahane or any other batsman for that matter in place of Dhawan. It can\'t be worse than having Dhawan.' 	2	-3

It is so sad to see a batsman of Rahane's caliber being wasted by the team management . Look at people like Amla , Root , Williamson . Rahane could very well do the same job for us like they are doing for their team . If only our captain could think a little logically . Dhawan is a lottery at best and his consistency as an opener is worst among all teams . Nohit is a makeshift opener with the technique and hitting skills of a middle order batsman .  I wonder how come the so called think tank cannot make place for Rahane when 4 out of their top 5 is struggling like this . Wouldn't be surprised if we are beaten by West Indies easily ." 	2	-4
The worry is that law of averages should not catch up King Kholi.  The openers have to fir and play like Roy or Guptil or Munroe, without caring for their wicket. Then score can become 160  which will make a world of difference. Pandya cannot always deliver on the 20th over.  His 10 runs of last two balls would have cost us the match against Aussies. Try Harbajan. Replace Dhawan with Rahane &amp; Bhajji for Yuvi.' 	3	-4
The obvious change seems to elude the Team Mgmt. ROHIT is not an opener, and was in fact one of the best upcoming T20 middle-order/ finishers in the IPL a couple of years ago. Get him at #4....he'd be great smashing it around in the last 5 overs! RAHANE has been the most consistent Opener through IPLs. He's got the technique and is a fast scorer as an opener. RAINA is a great team man and deserves a place with his experience...but #5 or #6 (swapped with Dhoni)." 	3	-1
Everyone seems to be focussing on Raina, Yuvraj and Dhawan ignoring a completely underwhelming Rohit Sharma who has flattered to deceive right through this T20 World Championship. For someone who has been rated 'talented' time and over again, he has time and again been guilty of throwing his wicket away putting immense pressure on Virat and the middle order. Raina for one has contributed both with the ball and in the fielding department, something that Rohit cannot cannot claim to have done. If anything dropping him out of the team till he understands the meaning of the word consistency is the need of the hour. To come and play two breath taking shots and then surrender his wicket on a platter makes him the most vulnerable player in this squad." 	1	-4
Great choice of words, and twist of phrases, Karthik. Particularly, the ones on Raina.. he does define "chancy". I would love to see Rahane in the team, in Raina\'s place... to provide some stability in the middle order, should the Law of Averages catch up with Kohli. [I tend to gush every time I write his name..so, will avoid the emotions this one time]. Of course, assuming that.. the Titanic philosophical shift.. from chancy ball belting.. to real cricket shots [T20 is cricket, too, after all.. beyond the circus] happens tonight.

@BARUN SHARMA: I already stated that my bet is with Manish Pandey to replace Yuvraj. What will Dhoni &amp; Shastri do is anybody's guess! Dhoni has his own logic which includes Unchanged XI, whether it is balanced or not. In my opinion, Raina is NOT a #4 bat but it is Dhoni's decision. MSD puts Raina there with a vain hope that he can hit any bowling. Rohit &amp; Dhawan fail in 3 out of 4 outings especially when they play world class bowlers on spicy pitches. Both Rahane &amp; Pandey are proper batsmen but they have no chance of getting in XI till Dhoni's unchanged XI has an injury. Now that vacancy has arisen, it is rumoured that he is entertaining the thought of including Negi to replace Yuvraj- a frightening thought when India has 3 out of top 4 bats failing consistently. Is this Indian XI or Dhoni's XI? Has Rationality no place in XI selection?" 	3	-4
@Barunsharma : Small trivia for you. Sachin took 78 matches to score his first century.. If anyone had expected instant results from him, we wouldn't have seen Sachin. Give Hardik Pandya time. 50 Odis   T20 Min before coming to a conclusion. And India needs proper 4 batsmen excluding MSD. So including Pandey or Rahane is a clear selection choice. I fear MSD and Ravi Shastri will select Negi expecting him to score a quick fire 20 25. What if situation requires consolidation over explosiveness.. Logical choice is to include Pandey or Rahane in place of Yuvraj." 	1	-4
@Nampally "India has 3 more all rounders in Jadeja, Pandya &amp; Ashwin" on paper yeah but in reality Jadeja is worse batsmen of them all in T20I\'s. Ashwin at best strikes at 100 S/R which is no good for late order hitter. So his position as a allrounder is also not discounted in batting order. Now its only left to Pandya who is more suited to order of his batting. For me Yuvi @ 5 was a big hit if you consider match situations. Dhoni cleverly sends Yuvi for consolidation which he is doing aplomb. Yuvi did fail in Accelerating . Now about Raina only good innings he had after long time was against Bangla that too he couldn\'t build on it. Being in Bangalore where ground size should help Raina for his lofted shots this was his best shot to come back to form against supposedly weaker bowling he did top score but was edgy at his best. Rohit is still living in his past glory and was making sure India score less then 30 against OZ (17 b 12 runs) . Shikhar always looks in form n gets OUT in WC!' 	2	-3
So much on the batting failures but nothing on Rohit???' 	1	-3
@Nampally You assume things a lot. Suresh Raina was power hitter earlier because he used to bat down the order earlier. The same was the case with Yuvraj. When someone coming at batting order 3 and 4, what their role should be to stabilize team and provide momentum for the final push during last overs. Nowadays, Role of Raina and Yuvi are different and don't expect them to play power hitters all the time but yes, It is expected the role of power hitters from Jadeja, Pandya and others who bat down the order. Raina definitely failed in his new role but I don't agree with Yuvi. He always delivered when India needed except one or two fails. I have a lot doubt with Rahane. After given so many opportunities, he couldn't prove that he is really a T20 player. Definitely, he is a very good batsman for Test and ODIs but T20 isn't meant for him. I will pick Manish Pandey ahead of him in T20 anytime." 	3	-4
Let us see how Pandya holds his nerve against Gayle, Russell, Fletcher, Bravo and Samuels...' 	1	-2
India has been playing Raina &amp; Yuvraj as power hitting all rounders. But both have performed below par &amp; have become more or less as "Utility" players. India has 3 more all rounders in Jadeja, Pandya &amp; Ashwin who follow. When a team is packed with too many half baked all rounders it is difficult to have either a strong bowling or batting. Kohli is the "One-Man" batting who has literally carried India into the Semi Final, at least in batting. India needed someone like Rahane or Pandey to strengthen their batting at #4. Raina, as free swinger, is at best a #6 bat NOT #4.Dhoni wants to bat at #6 rather than #4.Despite missing #4, India somehow managed to reach the Semi. Now Yuvraj out with injury, India needs a specialist bat @#4. My bet is it will be Manish Pandey who gets the nod. Thought of including Negi is infantile &amp; hope Dhoni will not entertain it. India needs production from all top 4 bats not Just Kohli. That is the need of the hour.' 	3	-2
"They have kept their faith in Raina. Neither has rewarded that faith, just yet." - what a load of non-sense. Not long ago (how long was that, perhaps a month?) Raina played a match winning innings in that 3rd T20 against Australia. Unfortunately for us, four of our batsmen are not in great form. What will happen if replace all of them at once? - it\'s anybody\'s guess. I am glad Dhoni\'s thinking process is not the same.' 	2	-3
Dhawan and Raina have been horrid and need to go. Yuvraj is different. He had been playing sensibly even though he is out of form. When he comes into his own its different ball game.' 	2	-4
@RIP_TESTCRICKET I am really sorry. I am watching all India T20 matches since Aussie series and I have seen Pandya playing as allrounder only managed one good knocks against weak Bangladesh team. His stats itself explain all : 15matches, \t78runs\t31heighest\t11.14 average. Where does he stands in the category of best batsman. Sorry, I don't agree. Most of the time, I have seen getting out silly either on duck or hitting silly on long on. If he is the standard of a good batsman, India should need to do soul search for really good player otherwise, India will be like another Pak team." 	3	-3
knowing dhonis style of management I don't see any drastic changes. Raina , Dhawan and yuvraj in that order have been mediocre.  People are being sentimental about yuvraj than using logic. He is trying hard but he does not have the ability to change game like he has done in past. India would have lost to aussies if he had continued" 	3	-2

why people talking about Harbhajan? how he played in overall matches, and how many times won man of the match compared to the all spinners from all over the world, it is not an achievement, its below average,  I see him most of the time will go sleep during fielding and batting, only he encourages active shouting during his quota of overs.  mostly will go asleep when running between the wickets, or in the pitch while on batting like old days WV Raman,' 	2	-1

People talks a lot about top 4 failures out of top 5. I think, Yuvi did his job fair enough. He ensured good partnership with Kohli whenever Indian team needed to build partnership. Purpose of middle order isn't to hit only with good strike rate. We will miss Yuvi definitely. He bowling against Australia was very very critical. One player always missed scrutiny and that is no other but Hardik Pandya. I haven't seen any Substantial batting from his end except few spark here and there. His fielding is good but bowling is so so average. On what expense, he should play in team? Most of pitches are spin friendly and we need another spin bowler than Hardik Pandya. If its pace bowling friendly pitch,  Bhuvnesh Kumar is better bowler and better batsman tham him. Why people not talking about his performance? He is newcomer and if he won't prove himself now then when?" 	2	-3

@TRUE-CRICKET_LOVER, well said! We're not interested in consistent and fighting cricketers. All we want is the flashy ones. They almost calibrate their game so as to fire (or is it misfire, considering not firing is their normal mode!) once in 8-10 games and retain their spot for the next 10.

Yuvraj will miss out and Manish Pandey will play for sure. No problem with the batting. There were few rank turners and some poor shots behind the unsuccessful Indian top order. All of them will score runs on Wankhede's flat track. One problem that India will now face is that there will be no Yuvraj who could have bowled 1 or 2 overs. India will have 5 options and Raina. No support from pitch means Pandya and Nehra going for runs. India can play Negi or Harbhajan in place of Pandya because West Indies look vulnerable against spin." 	2	-3
If we go through the stats Rahane is the most consistent batsman in IPL in the last three years, he hold on to that Orange cap for longer duration too. But he couldn't find a spot in the team.

Yuvraj is the best batsman among team after Kohli. If you are good cricket analyst Yuvraj had stopped India from loosing in two matches even in the last match also. Don't you guys don't know cricket. Even though hitting the ball is T20 format it alone will not win the games. Some good partnership should be their in middle order to win the game. Because Yuvraj stood their till 15th over only then they were able to hit and win in the last overs. For suppose if Yuvraj is out for 1 or 2 runs. There are 90 % of chances India might have lost because of pressure. That was the boost given by Yuvraj to his team.  There are lot of mind games going on in the team for captaincy and in that mind games Yuvraj is the sufferer......" 	2	-4
Same eleven would be always better, it is psychological advantage for Kohli and Dhoni, and this is what dhoni follows. it is like doctors prescription to the patient,  if top three performs, and down three won't make an notified impact , because it won't fir perfect for kohli to courage to perform well. balance is not about the skill alone. it is all about the mind with team commitments." 	2	-2

I fully agree with the author of this article. Batting used to be India's strength, but it is now India's weakness. There are other areas of weaknesses too. India's bowling is not very threatening to the opposition. There was a time when Indian spinners were the best, but not any more. Are they capable of raising the level of their game and win the World Cup? It is possible." 	4	-2
Both Raina and Yuvraj deserve to be dropped. Yuvraj is a old warhorse now and Raina seems to score only when playing in IPL. This tournament is likely to be the last for both.' 	2	-1
Knowing Dhoni, he would absolutely minimize changes in the team given that they have been winning (somehow!). He is unlikely to drop Raina, even though Raina has been the worst batsmen of all sides in this tournament. There is a case for Dhawan being replaced by Rahane, but I doubt if Dhoni will do that (unfortunately, Rahane himself has been desperately poor in many of the recent matches). He is unlikely to drop Rohit because of his phenomenal past record against WI and AU on flat pitches. That leaves, only one change feasible - Negi replacing Yuvraj in case the latter is unfit on Thursday. So in summary, India's failing batsmen will keep their places in the side and have to deliver in the upcoming knock out matches or the team will be under severe pressure." 	2	-3

I like the article. I see a lot of people calling for dropping players. I think the first thing we need to look at is bad form or draining of runs. The difference is bad form is temporary where as draining of runs would be noticed over a long period of time. This is the difference between Raina vs Rohit. Raina is drained of runs, he only has 3 t20 international 50's ever, none since 2010. This last 50 was against Zimbabwe. His last significant innings was Against Australia a 49* that won us the game. There has been a massive decrease in run scoring from this player over the last 3 years. Not many T20i's sides have a number 4 with no half centuries in the last 5 years. Rohit on the other hand has recently improved consistent performances in Australia and a century against South Africa and a match winning 83 against Bangladesh in the Asia cup suggest this player is growing better. In this world cup he could be going through bad form. Don't remove a player due to form on the short run." 	2	-2

Now it's too late to make any change in the team . But if India has to be consistent at the top then non-performers players like Dhawan Yuvi and Raina has to be replaced with Young generation player . IPL format and standard is up to the level . So Why  not the players who are performing in IPL are given chance to play in T2o . On what basis they are selecting the team for T2o . Selectors can select T20 team by watching Ranji performance . Compare the stats of S.Dhawan Yuvi with S.Iyer in last IPl . H.Pandya and J.burmah have already shown us that they can perform at even International level if they have given proper backup and confidence .IF Nehra comeback was possible due to IPl only . India has made the change in the bowling department and the result is there . Why not trying out someone like S.Iyer at the top ? If we are looking for finisher S.yadav and D.Hooda would be the better choice then Yuvi and S.Raina ." 	2	-1
As Dhoni said before on Bhuvaneshwar Kumar: With time Bowlers/Batsmen should mature and seek the next level, EG: Ashwin, Jadeja and Kohli: they had their weakness but they worked on their game and reached a status of Respect from the opponents. But Rohith, Dhawan and Raina are still an upset, despite all playing more than 100 international games during a period of over 4-5 years... Bring in Sarfaraz Khan into this team, he has the NOFEAR attitude required for T20 and can bown Leggies and Medium pace as additional attributes...' 	3	-3
Difficult call to make. Both Yuvraj and Raina are match winners on their days, but the question is are those days in this World Cup? I guess the advantage both have is that they can bowl handy overs. Yuvraj certainly has bowled some valuable overs. Rahane is the obvious choice to come into the XI, but who would he replace? In my opinion it should be Raina.' 	2	-2
I have a feeling however, India won't make a change. It's common throughout many past world cups that they go with the same XI for as long as possible." 	1	-1
Yuvraj has placed some crucial innings, albeit small and shaky but he uses his confidence to ensure he is still there. Raina is a real hit or miss right now, and in my opinion is batting too high at 4, especially because he is having to come in early due to Rohit and Dhawan's poor form. Let Rahane come in. There is no harm in making a chance in a knock out match when you're dropping an out of form player." 	2	-3
If India doesn't drop Dhawan/Rohith on Thursday at Wankhede, and if they lose because of their top order's failure, then still I'm sure this same 15 devoid of Yuvraj (who has played decent in comparison) will be retained... Raina: Maybe we should try changing his jersey colour to yellow... that would be the last attempt :)" 	1	-3
With Indian Cricket: It has always been the case that a few get more chances despite the ratio of their success is 1 out of 6 or 7 matches. EG: Rohith has always scored big on Flat trackes, we have not seen him play a fighting innings like how Kohli plays, Shikhar dhawan scores a Hundred at the verge of a Drop, but prior to that for 5,6,7 innings he stays pu in the team with the hope of him scoring big, despite the reason that he gets out playing cheeky... By now Rahane should have been the Mr.Dependable opener who could play his shots up the order and anchor the innings, but Kohli has been doing that as a single guy... If wankhede pitch is flat, Rohith and Dhawan will thrive but that performance will definitely allow them a cushion of 10 more matches... Yuvraj: his body is giving up and better for him to retire and give chance to Manish who is craving up for opportunities before his age dries up...' 	3	-3
India will though need to review the team post the world cup. Raina looks out of depth and should make way for someone like Manish Pandey. Yuvraj has played a stellar role in a few matches, his contribution has been immense for India in some of the difficult matches they played against Pakistan and Australia, but clearly his time is over and this could be his swansong. Dhawan always looks in form, but consistency is a challenge. Rohit Sharma clearly is a king on flat tracks, but you dish out difficult tracks to him - pace, bounce, swing, spin and high quality bowlers and he is  found out. Temperament is a challenge with him guess that's why he is not successful in tests. Still he is an asset in the short forms. India needs to explore Manish, Kedar, Shreyas and others post the world cup irrespective of the results." 	2	-3
Dhawan, Rohit, Raina all are match winners. India just need to notable innings in the remaining matches and with the SF being in Mumbai, i am sure one of these can play a matchwinning innings. I would refrain from making any changes in the WC unless Yuvraj gets injured. Manish should then probably replace him, Rahane suits more as an opener. India is currently winning owing to Kohli's batting, the immense contribution from their bowling and fielding and Dhoni's astute captaincy. Beauty of T20 cricket is that one player can carry most of the team and still win the match, which Kohli is doing via his batting. India must thank their fortune that they have Nehra &amp; Bumrah who have turned around India's bowling stocks immensely, its pretty unbelievable that two months back no one would have seen them as being India's bowling spearhead in the WC. With all the batting frailties, India still look favorites because of Kohli's hunger &amp; because of the fact that Dhoni likes to write his own script." 	3	-2
I think its unfair to include Yuvi here, sometimes only the number of runs do not matter...Yuvi has played 2 crucial innings and stayed giving support to Kohli who has been batting as if on another planet. Yuvi's contribution pales only because of what he is capable of, we are so used to see him blast the opposition out day in and day out that a strike rate of 110 plus on testing wickets is being questioned, which I feel is unfair...those few 20s he made were important innings....Raina is clearly the black sheet along with Dhawan...both seem to do well when the ball is not moving and pitch is not bowler friendly..which is where Dhoni's persistence theory may hurt India bad..In manish pandey and Rahane they have two thoroughly deserving people waiting, it is as if dhoni would feel vindicated if raina dhawan would make one 30-40 in 10 matches, which manish and rahane can as well do..dhoni really needs to show a bit more flexibility..we havent been best team, but we havent been worst !!!!" 	2	-4
The only possibility for a replacement is if Yuvraj is not fit. In that case MSD might play Pandey as a lower order batsman as Rahane can play only in top 3. Negi might not play as Rohit, Shikar, and Raina are not in form. Had the openers been if form, Negi can replace Yuvraj and come in at 4 and try to smash it. So that Raina can play down the order. But that won't happen. Instead if Yuvi is not fit Pandey will get a game. A bowling option will be lost.Shikar and Rohit are not consistent and don't bowl. Pandey and Rahane might be similar and not huge hitters and won't bowl. Raina and Yuvraj can bowl and filed but don't bat well." 	1	-2
God only knows how Rohit gets so many chances that equal to Dhawan and only Dhawan gets all the beating not Nohit!! First of all, why is he allowing Dot balls in T20. If you cannot hit all the balls out of park, agreed, can you not rotate strike. He gives enough confidence to all the bowlers - new or old!!! Bowlers feared to face Sehwag, Sachin / Ganguly/Gambir (on several occassions), but the case with Nohit is, they know that he will eat balls to get to that mood of hitting. So till then, it is benefit to them (may be 10 to 12 dot balls) and then, they will work him out, by inducing him to play some non-sense shots due to pressure of those dot balls, why he made himself.  I also beleive Nohit gets praised by all commentators for his LAZY Elegance, all the Timing he has got playing shots, blah blah blah etc repeatedly, so IND can put up with him eternally for his once in blue moon performance. I also believe all these Non-performers will perform like a Charm once the IPL bell rings!!!' 	3	-3
It seems Raina cannot handle 90 miles hr deliveries and specially short balls, he has trouble with spinning wickets and the off spinner has been his night mare. Yvraj has trouble with short pitch balls throughout his career and his reflexes are slowing down also. India has real problem at hand because only Kohli and Dhoni are batting with confidence. Yuvi is playing a balancing act at present but India might need fire works from him like old times and question is.....can he provide that' 	2	-2
Yuvi has not done badly, he deserves to be in, if he is fit. The other three need to be pulled up for taking their place for granted- "rash shots don\'t win matches; learn patience" Secondly, India does not need a big hitter like Pandey at this stage (Hardik, Dhoni, Jaddu can manage that), rather they need someone like Rahane who can play second fiddle to Kohli. Quick loss of wickets has been a problem And Rahane deserves a chance.' 	2	-3
MSD is not know for making changes so late in the game. If Yuvi is 80% he will play. Full stop. I don't see Dhawan-Rohit combo broken as MSD has faith in Dhawan who can suddenly up his game in a finals as he usually does. It will be a miracle if Windies don't target Dhawan, Raina and Yuvi with bouncers. It will be aplenty in display and how these three cope up will determine the results. Ash once again will be key and its hard for Jaddu to keep firing all 6 balls on the toes of some of the biggest hitters in the game. To me if Simmons play he along with Russell are the most dangerous and can become nemesis." 	2	-2

IND's top 5 batsmen except Kohli have struggled in T20WC 2016. They did have good performances in series v AUS &amp; SL. IND did not have a good batting preparation prior to the tournament due to the green tops at Asia Cup. Based on overall performances in the T20WC degree of disappointment (decreasing order) has to be 1. Rohit 2. Dhawan 3. Yuvraj 4. Raina. Both the openers have gone too hard in power play while the other 2 batsmen have not adapted to modified roles in match situations. It is time for batsmen to improve short selection, adapt to match situations &amp; provide a solid batting foundation. Considering the strengths of WI, IND don't need to make more than 1 change for injured Yuvraj, If IND do make more than 1 change it could well backfire &amp; critics may well have change the query to why new players weren't tried earlier. It is significant that IND recently lost ODI series in AUS 1-4 after drastic changes &amp; lost in SF of CWC 2015 with just 1 50 innings each from Rahane &amp; Kohli ." 	2	-2
If Dhoni were a captain of soccer team, he probably would not make any substitution. Not changing 11, can't change 11, too late to change, etc are unscientific theories. Innovative thinkers such as NZ has said before its SF that it would go for horses for courses." 	1	-1

Dhawan, Rohit and Raina are three who are enjoying the fruits of Kohli and Dhoni. It is proved once on the first match of this T20 World cup, that India cannot cross 100 runs if Kohli and Dhoni can not contribute much. It is time for the openers to open their eyes in the Semifinal at least. Remember that this selection committee gives preference for form and consistency (Nehra).' 	3	-1
Raina had taken his place for granted as he has put on weight and that will affect his movements and it shows. Yuvi must play if he is fit. Rohit and Dhawan do not guarantee a good opening burst as both of them had misfired and literally saved by Kohli's consistency. Dhoni must bring in some change to be on toes to fight in the SF clash with WI. Giving the players a guarantee on their previous performances and reputation is not logic at all in this sport, especially when people like Manish, Rahane are waiting in the dug out." 	2	-3
Either Yuvraj or Raina need to sitout and give place to Rahane. He is a cool customer when low scores like 120, 140 requires just singles and odd boundary. Dhoni can play Jadeja/Pandey up in the order above Rahane if hard hitting required.' 	2	-2
This is more about being fair to all players. Players like dhawan and raina seem to be receiving unlimited chances over the last few years and their scores have not justified their assured place in the team, no matter how many times they fail. Rahane who has been outstanding in the last few years, especially on fast pitches and against quality pace attacks, has been a passenger without getting a fair number of chances. Also dhoni now talks about players making certain spots their own by peforming solidly but in the Bangladesh series, rahane who had performed well in the middle order, was shuffled in the batting order just to accommodate rohit sharma. And we have seen that the constant failures of dhawan, raina etc have been covered only by Kohli's brilliance otherwise India would have been out in the first round itself, so it is high time dhoni selects the team keeping the teams best interests in mind." 	3	-3
Raina is seating duck whenever pitch offers a bit to bowler in either spin or seam. It is not a speculation. His record shows that. His dismal test record confirms that. Give him a flat pitch and he transforms in to a world beater. Add Dhwan another one who struggles on the difficult conditions and you have scratchy start on hand that puts all the pressure on Kohli. Yuvraj is different cattle of fish. It is known that he is in twilight years but give him a big occasion and he will find a way to contribute. He will hang in there and provide a helping hand to his team. Asia cup and this world cup against Pakistan he was at the other end when Kohli was winning the world over. Not Raina not Dhwan not Rohit. India had such a difficult world cup due to failure of Rohit, Raina and Dhwan. And there non contribution is not surprising given that India has been playing on difficult decks. MSD needs to take a call on million   question, weather his team can overcome a Kohli failure in knock outs.' 	2	-3
It is Dhawan, Rohit and Raina, not Yuvraj. Yuvraj was holding the fort at the other end during the last match (and earlier matches too) allowing his partner to score freely. Unfortunately, he was injured during the last match. Yes, his reflexes have slowed down, but he isn't throwing away his wicket like Dhawan, Rohit and Raina. Rahane could still come in at 4 instead of Raina and score some 25 or 20 balls instead of succumbing to short balls every time." 	2	-2

I feel picking pandey in place of Yuvi to be strange. Yuvi proved to be more than a handy bowler at many instances. In case a bowler is having a bad day (Ashwin against Aus). Yuvi will be more hands on than anyone else. I think he must be backed up by Someone like Gurkreet Mann, who can bowl and Fire as a finisher. I agree he is not upto mark in Australia, But Indian grounds must be comfortable to him in shorter format.' 	2	-2
It should be Rain, Yuvraj and Dhawan testing the faith.' 	2	-1
Raina appears to be overweight and unfit. He should take a leaf out of Kohli or Dhoni's book in regards to fitness. Raina, you are give a chance to represent billions of Indian fans, make the most of it." 	1	-2
pandey should come in for yuvi if he is declared unfit ! otherwise same team.' 	1	-2
And why can't Dhoni kick out Rohit Sharma and not Dhawan and simply bring Rahane?" 	2	-1
Yuvi will definatly fire. Raina is good fielder and good supporting bowler. These two can not be replaced in this WC. After that we can replace any one or two. If you want to replace replace Dhawan with Ajinkya OR Manish. These two will definitely will fire Semi final or final. Beter to look on Ajinkya instead or Dhawan. Rahane is came good in IPL as opener than Dhawan.' 	2	-1
why there is no mention of the hyped but miserably failing Rohit Sharma, he has come a cropper so far in this T-20 World cup, still the team management day dream for a miracle to happen in this regard. Let them take a leaf out of New Zelanders' book,though they have great seamers in Tim Southee  and Trent Bolt , they have fielded a fine bunch of eleven cricketers who have not let down there team ;horses for courses,here in Indian team certain horses regularly fail yet they are pampered" 	3	-4
Rahane should come in and open the innings with Dhawan. Kohli at 3 and Rohit at 4 (where he normally bats for MI in IPL). Its time for Raina to go and learn to play short pitch balls.' 	1	-1
Include Rahane instead of either Dhawan or Raina. Rest of the team is just okay unless Yuvi is replaced due to injury. Pandey is an idol replacement but Yuvi's bowling will be missed." 	1	-2
We have to leave aside sentiments and play like a professional team.  If India persist with those non performing players it will start a worst precedence where by all captains coming after Dhoni will give chance to their preferred eleven irrespective of merit.  Atleast to avoid this,  I hope good sense prevail and players are selected based on current form for the knockout games' 	3	-3
It should be a major concern that India, with its vast pool of top-level cricketers, has to go into a home T20 World Cup carrying three players (Yuvraj, Nehra and Harbhajan Singh) - all of whom are very clearly past their Sell-By Date at this level.' 	1	-2
Experience undoubtedly has a significant value, but - with the amount of T20 (IPL, etc) that the Indians play - where are the younger guys who should be filling those slots?' 	2	-1

i have been a big fan of pandey from his underage cricket and have followed him from then but going in with him as replacement for yuvi isnt a wise thing to do as he as never played the role of finisher in t20 so expecting him to do that and do it successfully in semifinal of WC would be asking for too much so its a lot better to have rahane at 4 and push raina to 5....if yuvi is fit then raina has to be dropped and rahane needs to take his place' 	3	-1
Pandey should have been in the team from the beginning. A brilliant player with strong nerve, this is what we need now! About time Raina and Yuvi stay out; not sure of Rahane. He's never been impressive. Negi could be given a chance rather than him. Dhawan and Rohit are class players, a few innings without big scores shouldn't mean they need to sit out. The author has analysed it very well. Really hopeful either Yuvi or Raina would be replaced with Pandey!" 	3	-2
If Yuvi is injured, Pandey, though not in the original squad, can come in, even in the last minute, with ICC's permission. Logistics alone used to create delays in such emergency substitutions. But, fortunately, that isn't the case of Manish Pandey." 	1	-2
A batsman who didn't have match practice (say Pandey, or Rahane for that matter) may play only at about 75%. But isn't 75% better than 65%?  And, far better than 35%, excluding Dhoni's accompaniment to the virtuoso soloist Kohli?" 	3	-1

I was there at Wankhede during IND-SA warm ups and honestly Rahane struggled big time. In case Yuvi doesn't make it to the squad then Pandey/Negi can be the only options." 	1	-2
I even feel if Pandey comes in, he really needs to run well b/w the wickets. He is at times has brain fades at the crease. Saw him doing that that exactly at the DY Patil Stadium few days back.' 	1	-1

Rahane has not performed in any of the matches in Asia Cup , India-SL series or even the WT20 practice matches.' 	1	-1
Rahane needs to prove his worth as a top 3 batsman at the moment. He has played flamboyant innings but right now he is struggling. Dhoni is living in the present and Rahane at middle order is just not right!' 	1	-2
I won't prefer Negi because WI batsman will probably target him very badly and batting depth suffers if Negi is replaced by Yuvi." 	1	-4
You can't replace Raina with Rahane......Rahane is only good at opening the innings....so let him swap Dhawan.But that's an unlikely change in the semis.We have to stick to the same 11. Dhawan is due for a good innings.He will defenitly play well to retain his spot in the team.Same is the case with Rohit.Also the match is at wankhede,where Rohit is at his best in IPL." 	2	-1
Indian selectors have made the error of not including Manish Pandey in the original squad, he is a quality act as we saw against Australia in Australia. He is a match winner like Kohli, makes no sense not having him in the side and non performer like Raina getting so many chances.' 	2	-2
The Indian team once again is a 1 man show ! The only reason for its victory in Asia cup and do far in WT20 is Virat Kohli, nothing more. Wherever Virat has not scored they fold' 	1	-1
People criticising Rainafor a Rahane are missing a point here. As the writer himself has correctly pointed out it is very rare Raina wastes any deliveries. In his good touch he can score upto 170 SR. On the other hand I have seen many innings of Rahane when he has scored at 110 or 115 SR even when he is in good touch. There is a reason why people like raina are difficult to remove from a t20 side.' 	2	-2
whenever Yuvraj has batted, its been of help for the team. he may have scored just at sub-100 strike rate. But the important thing is that he had given Kohli the security to think about timing the chase well or timing the innings well knowing fully that Yuvraj will stay around for a few overs. It has really helped Kohli to play his natural game, settle in and go for the kill once he is settled... on the bowling front, Yuvraj won India the game with a spell of 3 overs for 19 plus a wicket. he more than filled Ashwin's quota of overs, who looked terrible for his 2 overs. Yuvraj also multiplied the drying of runs" 	2	-4
1. I like Raina but he's been a frustrating international cricketer. I think his time is up after this world cup." 	2	-3
3. Dhawan is over-rated. His test and T20 record are sub-par. I think he's done well in ODIs despite being inconsistent. Rahane should replace him at the top in the T20s." 	1	-2
5. Harbajan should not have been in the team. I mean what are his chances of playing in place of Ashwin?' 	2	-1
2. I don't know what to say about Rohit. I hope he will come good at the business end of the tournament." 	3	-1
4. Yuvraj should never have been part of this team. He single-handedly lost the previous world cup final. He was not part of the plans in the next one and a half years and suddenly in the last six months, he's in the team. He hasn't looked like playing a substantial innings. I can understand Dhoni having him because of his bowling but he's hardly bowled in this tournament. Manish Pandey should have been in the team, especially after playing that match winning innings in Australia." 	2	-1
Wrong time for Yuvi to exit,esp when he is being his fluent best at hitting those free flow sixers and supporting Kohli in the middle with experience.Big big loss for India that.' 	2	-3
why have a squad of 15 exactly and MSD has to answer it. Semis so what, who ever comes Kohli and MSD are not going to change their game. apart from ashwin bumraj nehra jadeja,who ever plays doesnt matter .The replacements can actually take place of Rohit,who is playing like a spectator. Dhawan is fielding well taking catches well at pressure situation.Bring in two spinners Bhajji &amp; Negi .Ind can open with Kohli and dhawan, with Raina coming one down followed by MSD and Pandya.If these cant hit out no point in asking tailenders to do the job.' 	2	-2
Yuvraj Singh almost cost India the game by not retiring hurt. His inability to run help increase the scoring rate which otherwise would have been at manageable level...he should take the opportunity and announce his retirement.' 	3	-2
Lot of people are forgetting that Yuvraj has had only 1 bad game.' 	1	-2
I 100% agree that he is not the same flamboyant Yuvraj of the past. That Yuvi is hiding in there somewhere at the moment. But he has given balance to the side and did everything that has been asked of him.' 	1	-1
I can see Pandey coming in for Yuvi if he is not fit, but if he is fit, he has to play. It gives us additional bowling option.' 	1	-1
He bowled very well when he was asked to when our mainstream spinners were clobbered. And he has batted as the situation required in the rest of the games. India needed partnerships when Yuvi had walked in. Not fast runs. He has provided exactly what team needed at that stage without worrying about personal gains. A lesser character would have tried to slog and show he is in good touch to keep his place in team. But this guy did what was needed in previous games as well.' 	2	-4
Ideally he should be coming ahead of Raina but that has not happened. There is very little he can do about that situation.' 	1	-1
Let's see what these ppl do in the semis now....Dhawan, Raina &amp; Rohit are all IPL material. Indian selectors will realize soon after Dhoni departs. It  will be hard for India to fill his shoes especially when you have these 3 greats in the team. Also there was no need of Harbhjan visiting Australia when some young blood could have easily gained the experiance. Also there is no need of Yuvraj, batting lineup. Thank you very much and enjoy the game. India is lucky they won the game against Aussies &amp; 100% Yuvraj was to be blamed if results were  He wasted 3-5 balls, doubles, time &amp; concentration of Virat..Yuvraj should have walked out retied hurt." 	3	-3
It amazes me that no oneis questioning extremely poor batting performance of Indian's EXCEPT the Great (yes, now we can call him that) Kohli. What is shameful is favouritism shown in selecting Raina. He has been given so many chances just because he is Dhoni's best buddy!. Ajinkya Rahane is the best Indian batsman only after Kohli. Yet, he is conveniently dropped to find a place for Raina. Yuvraj is a past star. You don't play a world cupt with a half fit past star. In his place Manish Pandey should have been in. Similarly Akshar Patel (in place of another past star Nehra) should play in the team. One can understand chances given to Dhawan and Rohit. Both have immense talent, but it is high time they show it in performance. India is a Nation of 1.25 billion. Our talent pool is rich. But favouritism is ruining the performance. Rather we take refuge is shinning stars like Kholi. Again, comparing Kohli with Sachin is not on yet. One day he may be greater than Sachin, but long way to go." 	3	-4

If Yuvi is unavailable due to injury, then I would actually have Rahane open with Dhawan and have Rohit play at No 4. Play Raina at 5. And keep rest of the squad unchanged. Raina is not a No 4 batsman. He is better off at no 5.' 	1	-2
And why is Rohit Sharma an automatic selection? Dhawan scores over Rohit Sharma on temperamental stuff. He has delivered in critical situations before. Rohit except scoring big in nondescript games has never delivered in crunch. There are severe temperamental issues exhibit A is also how he approaches test cricket .His mental preparation for championship games show lack of composing an innings either tuk-tuk or slam bang. With Dhawan there was a silver lining in last game and the pressure of Rohit not doing anything got Dhawan to try an extravagant hook.' 	1	-2

I saw a couple of comments on Rohit, but just before this WT20, he was firing all cylinders and was the most consistent batsman. This year he is one of the tope 3 rungetters in both ODIs and T20s and suddenly one series goes bad and couple of people start saying he does not perform..Shame people' 	1	-3
Yuvi is now just a mere reflection of his old self. He looks so vulnerable against pace and bounce. In 2014 T20 finals, in Asia cup and now the present WT20 we can clearly notice his weaknesses. He was a liability in the last match too. But Kohli's brilliance his the weaknesses of the other batsmen. All that Kohli needed in his current form was a kid with a stick who can give the strike back to him and keep pace with him, which MSD did. Yuvi with his injury and poor running almost made a mess of that match. Rest of the batsmen too are not in any form worth mentioning. Let us hope at least a couple of others steps up in the semi's Cheers!" 	3	-3
The author is not being fair to Yuvraj. Yuvraj may not be at his fluent best , but he had to rebuild the innings with Kohli on with India losing the top 3 with little on the board.These were knockout matches high-pressure situations while chasing but let's not be uncharitable , but for those partnerships, India would have lost against Pakistan . It was unfortunate he got injured else he might have added a few more run to the total. He has also contributed with the ball as well. The problem for India is the lower order , they hardly infuse any confidence , once we lose top 6 there is no stokes/butler /mmali ." 	2	-3
Yuvi, Raina, Rohit and Dhawan has been feeding on the brilliance of Kohli in the recent past. Kohli may be the best in world cricket today, but he too will perish if he has to continue shouldering such pressure for long. It will be good if Yuvi's injury keeps him out of the future matches. This will allow Pandey to take his place. It would be good if Rahane or even Negi comes in place of Raina. As of now don't think we have any better options for openers, as we have already seen that Rahane is also Vulnerable against pace and swing initially, but he sure may do better than Dhawan or Rohit if given a longer rope. Let us hope that other batsmen also fire in the semi's as we need all guns blazing if Gayle has a good day. Cheers!" 	3	-3
I certainly don't blame Yuvi in fact, he helped india in both matches. Through out the tournament he came to bat under tremendous pressure because in all matches so far the 3 wickets fell in no time, courtesy Nohit, Dhawan, and Raina. So Yuvi and Kholi had to steady the innings for 5-6 overs rather than attacking the opponents. I just can't understand why Dhoni is still keeping Nohit, Dhawan, and Raina when Rahane, Manish and others are sitting. India can't afford to play with 8 players  in the Semi finals. In this case Dhoni is thick head." 	2	-3
Why not replace Rohit Sharma with Rahane. Both are good fielders and can't bowl well enough. Both right handers. 1 plays consistently and the other scores 200s every 20 games. 1 got 100s of chances and the other is blamed without enough games. Kohli and Dhoni should be beware of Rohit, Dhawan and Raina's inconsistency. Its funny that these are the 2 captains who supported them vigorously and these are 2 players on which all pressure falls and others free riding on Kohli and Dhoni. These 2 have unbelievable cricketing brains but have no foresight on where to invest. Thats what makes Ganguly a better captain. This is the reason we have to rely back on Yuvi and Bhajji because thats the best choice we had. Kudos to the selectors for forcing Pandya and Bumrah into the team. Give atleast 10% of chance Rohit/Raina received to Rahane and youngsters before its too late for next world cup." 	2	-2

How many years will it take for Raina to settle in an Indian Team? Everybody talks about his fielding ability. Rahane/Pandey are better fielders. Also Raina cannot field along the ropes. He dont have strong arm or accurate throw.' 	1	-1
Two days to go for the semifinals. No word on Yuvraj yet. Looks like he is fine and he will play. Manish and Rahane have to wait unfortunately even with an injury in the air floating around. It is what it is. Why are Yuvraj and Raina not announcing their retirement plans like Shane Watson did. They will earn more respect from fans if they do that right now. Dhawan (gets a decent run of failures before he comes up with one knock which helps him stay longer), Rohit, Yuvraj and Raina are putting this team under tremendous pressure every single game. Come on guys, you guys are done, we have a class batsman waiting for opportunities. move aside. move on.' 	3	-3
The dismal run of the openers and the bowler friendly pitches have actually helped Yuvi. He is clearly no longer the enforcer of the old times. The fact that the openers have fallen cheaply has meant that he has had to come in, and steady the ship with Kohli, and I daresay he has done a great job. Agreed that in Mohali, it almost cost us the match. But in the Asia cup, or even against Pakistan in the world cup, he has ended up playing crucial little supporting roles. In any case if he is ruled out, with Manish Pandey coming in, it might all be a blessing in disguise.' 	3	-2
After having read all the comments from readers of this article, I would suggest people to show some faith in the team chosen.' 	1	-1
If Yuvraj is injured, Rahane should play and bat at no. 4 as it is his home ground. Otherwise the same XI should play the match. I am sure these blokes will fire soon for Ind' 	1	-1
If we all were to suggest what is to be done, then why is there a team management and a captain. India deserved to be in the Semi-Final and they have made it there. What happens next will happen but we can hold our heads high with pride. MSD is a very good and shrewd captain, it is not easy to be the captain of an International team for 9 years. Virat Kohli has been fantastic, no words left to describe his prowess and ability. Rohit, Dhawan, Raina have misfired but it is right to back them as they are proven performers. Yuvraj is a match-winner any day. Rahane and Manish are great talents too but forcibly fitting them into a settled line-up can mess the momentum India have at the moment.' 	3	-1
Anyway there are two issues to address before making changes, other than the fitness issue of Yuvraj; (i) how good are the WI as far as strategy is concerned, do they prey on the weaknesses of the batsmen?  If not, then keep Dhawan and Raina, (ii) can the team deal with a newcomer like Pandey or Rahane?  There seems to be some good vibes in the team, despite abject failures from the top order.' 	2	-3
Yuvraj injury is blow for india.His batting is just ok and bowling ability is crucial for india.His short partnership with kohli shouldn't be discounted.Raina,dhawan and rohit has been putting hell lot of pressure repeatedly on dhoni and kohli in the last 4 matches.Raina seems very vulnerable against short ball.Rahane and pandey are good option for replacing raina and dhawan.But dhoni will not tinker with changes in last minute. Hope rest of the batsman come good against Windies." 	3	-4
There is no way to explain Raina's inclusion in any form of the game on technical merit or performance or potential for many years now from my perspective. It taints Dhoni's legacy somewhat, dragging along a non performer for so long. At least with Yuvraj there is a fear factor from earlier days. Rohit will win a game for you single handedly every now and then and Dhawan has had a few lovely innings against quality bowling in the ODI World Cup to point to. With Raina, except for a 50 in 2011 World Cup quarter final, his performance and technique is embarrassing." 	2	-4
Yuvi came in twice on hat trick ball. The openers (Rohit and Dhawan) have played more dot balls and then given wickets. Raina is a 2 over 15-20 batsmen. If not for Yuvi then India wouldnt have been 94/3 at 14 overs. 6 overs 66 to win against aussies.' 	1	-2
I would take playing 11 as' 	2	-1

This analysis is about 1,2,4,5 playing and making less than 3. But i don't see anything about Rohit . All i could read is Dhawan is a big match player. Raina either hits out or gets out. Yuvi is subdued version of his pre-cancer days .  Author has raised serious questions of India's top orders with numbers . Not sure why Nohit was not brought into this discussion .  Anyways India is still desperately waiting on Yuvi's fitness. Dhoni rarely changes his team and all throughout OZ , Asia cup, WC  series we have seen a settled combination. If Yuvi is match fit he will go for it . Fitness is main driving force rather than form since India relies on these same playing XI to win us WC. Don't see much in talking about weakness of any of these top order players when in middle of WC. Dhoni as always kept his cards close to his chest . If Yuvi misses out i am more worried about Jadeja's overs with Yuvi (SLA) based on conditions and right handed batsmen. 8 overs instead of 4 overs is a big gap!!!" 	2	-4
Rahane and Dhawan should open with Rohit sharma at 4 as we need some power hitters in the middle' 	1	-1
Spot on, article! Kholi apart, What are the rest of batsmen doing? Rohit again going into shell forgetting team and taking time to settle down at the cost of run rate while chasing. Selfish n shame. Dhawan must use his head n not just shoulders. Raina who..when..what..finally why is he still in team. His selection was based on future hypothesis that ipl star will fire in indian pitches. Raina n Negi sound reckless selections. Yuvraj, i think, even his most ardent fans are out of voice. He must stop looking serious n start scoring runs. Dhoni as shrewd as he is, just hiding low in the order. When was his last big score and looked in full flow. His keeping is genius but batting is well short. Also this right left obsession must go, n best batsmen must be selected. For ex, Manish Pandey well deserved Raina's place. Rahane deserves Dhawan's place." 	3	-4
After playing 10 years or so and still trying yo solve technicalities of batting, somehow it doesn't make sense to continue with Raina.  I guess he has two games left in his career if and if India reaches finals.  Move on from Raina and bring in somebody else with striking power preferably a youngster" 	2	-1
Straight from my mouth @YOGIFROMNY. Dhoni is very stubborn and it always looks like he wants to prove people that his persistence always pays off. This is probably the only ground with good pace and carry through to the keeper and I can say Rahane will have a gala time out there. He likes it when the ball comes on to the bat quicker. It suits his game. Chuck Dhawan for once. Pandey in for Yuvi and I hate to say it but Yuvi can't be a liability at a crucial phase. He knows it better than us having already been in this position once before. These changes, if Dhoni makes, will make sure All is Well! And yes make use of the 15 in the Squad dammit!" 	3	-4
It was shocking to select Yuvraj and Harbhajan in the 15 man squad and to let Yuvraj play despite his lost bat speed while he barely bowled is puzzling. On the flip side to leave Manish Pandey out of the squad in spite of him being one the most successful batsmen in IPL is sad. We are willing to risk the trophy for a couple of recommended players. Yuvraj is going to be liability and in the semis and final and his selection will come back and bite us in the back. Unfortunately us fans no clout to make it fair to beat a biased system.  On the other Raina is a major disappointment..he cant play short ball and couple of bouncers will fluster him and have him lose his wicket.' 	3	-4
If West Indies bowlers do well they will win, India has lot of free loaders who are not carrying their weight. Kohli, Nehra, Ashwin, and Bumrah have carried the team and to a lesser extent Dhoni and jadeja, rest of them have not performed.' 	1	-1

We won in 2011 because a misfiring Yusuf Pathan was replaced by Raina from quarter finals and Raina did well to save the Pak game.And Sreesanth replaced injured Nehra in final.In 2007,injured Sehwag was replaced by Yusuf Pathan in final.In all other World Cups,Dhoni kept playing the same and we couldn't win.Bottomline,we need to replace some players here.Any two of Manish,Rahane and Bhajji can replace Yuvi and Bhajji." 	2	-1
Continuing from my first post - this is a brilliant ploy by Dhoni. In the group stages, his excuse for playing Dhawan and other non-performers was "you need to give them a long rope, can\'t just drop them after a couple of bad performances". Now his excuse will be "can\'t experiment in the knockout stages!" Either way, his stubborn refusal to accept Rahane is way better than Dhoni\'s assessment of him is likely to cost India the WC. Dhoni\'s refusal to drop Yuvi cost us the 2014 WC final, so it won\'t be a first.' 	2	-3
Not including Rahane in place of Dhawan defies all logic! Dhoni is too stubborn to admit he was wrong and would rather mess with India's chances of winning than replace Dhawan. If you don't believe me, look at his persistence with Yuvraj in the 2014 WC, which did cost India the final. Bring in Pandey for Yuvi and Rahane for Dhawan: what are the selectors for if Dhoni is the one who calls the shots on team selection? Why have a team of 15 at all if you are only going to use 11 players regardless of their performance? From a disgusted Indian fan in NY." 	2	-4
I'd rather see Ajikya Rahane replace the opener with most dot balls in the WCT20 thus far. My reasoning is that he can rotate the strike and hold one end while the other opener attacks more freely. Only if Yuvi is injured, play Pandey in his place. Remember, Yuvi has delivered with the ball too." 	1	-3
rahane and panday in for dhawan and raina. yuvraj has done much better than these two liabilities with all bowling batting and fielding also. remember, one should not compare yuvraj with dhawan and raina. both got every chance in flat tracks since Australia to get their form in. but yuvraj not only never got such kinds of chance, but also rescued the team most of the time with kohli in some real crunch situations. like all three matches against Pakistan and some more matches. his bowling is additional asset to have. in vitual quarter final against Australia also, wothy yuvraj served with three crucial overs to compensate the costly ashwin, jadeja and pandya overs. injury is something else, otherwise he is needed with all aspects.' 	2	-3
What about the great Mr. Rohit Sharma? He has been failing BIG-TIME as well and if history is considered, he does not perform in big games when it really matters.' 	3	-3
In a way its great to see Pandey and Rahane at least in the reckoning. Dhawan should long have been replaced by Rahane after 3 consecutive failures and Raina shouldn't have been in squad at all after Asia cup disaster. Pandey should have been there instead. Rohit Rahane Kohli Pandey Yuvi Dhoni Jadeja Bhajji Ashwin Bumrah Nehra would have been the ideal squad. Pandey and Rahane could not have done worse than woeful Dhawan and Raina any day. Dhoni's decisions could have cost us big time in all matches but thanks to Kohli's brilliance we were saved the blushes." 	3	-3

But it is not just due to luck that India has reached SF !' 	3	-1
@EXPERIENCEISOVERRATED, that statement defies logic in the same way Dhoni's selections do. Rohit, Dhawan and Raina occupy the top 4 along with Kohli and with their wretched returns (right from the start of Asia Cup) have put pressure on everyone else in the order. If you want Raina's fielding (which is not as good as you think) bring him in as a sub for anyone. Yuvi has been instrumental in building partnerships with Kohli when all seemed lost is some very crucial matches. But like your screen name suggests, you don't get the value of experience. Btw so much is made of Yuvi's strike rate but Dhoni has been no hitter either and the less said about the batting 'ability' of Jadeja the better. How on earth a mediocre player like Negi made it over Mishra is something I will never get." 	2	-3
Yuvi played well against Pak and Aus. His experience in both batting and bowling is very much needed to team. He is building team winning partnerships at the crucial times. He will be fit and he will play semis for sure. Its better to replace Raina or Dhawan, who failed in this tournament so far.' 	2	-3
Dhoni will pick some Tom, Dick or Harry off the street than pick Rahane for a middle order spot - He is just too STUBBORN to admit that he was wrong all along - even if it costs India the WC. He can pickup Rohit ahead of Rahane for his bowling, Jadeja ahead of Mishra for his batting - and the list goes on. Rahane will have to wait until Dhoni steps down and at the same time maintain cordial relations with Kohli to find himself as a regular in IND team.' 	1	-3
It is easy to suggest that Raina should go and YuvRaj should go. People often forget that the reason why they were in the first place. It was not any body's charity that they established themselves in the positions they are. They performed and performed under pressure. Rahane is a good batsman but not certainly in the class of Raina or Yuvraj. Raina could start hitting from ball one which is a rare commodity. Sure, failures happen, but then who does not? Most talented and 360 degree players like Glen Maxwell and Steven Smith do fail. That's the nature of the game.Arriving in 14-15th over and start scoring right a way, at a rate of 12 an over, only few can do that. Raina and YuvRaj both left handed, could hit big sixes which is invaluable in T20 game. They do not need to carry on for ever, it is just for 3 to 4 overs. I honestly believe that they are still India's available best for the no.5 and 6. Failures..hm.. they happen to every one.." 	2	-3
Everything said and done, please no Rahane. He's no fit for T20. Let's have Manish Pandey or someone. Replacing one snail (Yuvi) with another (Rahane) is not a good idea." 	2	-2
Perfect analysis. Manish Pandey instead of Yuvraj gives a lot of confidence and assurance for fans, both on fielding and also running between the wickets. Also he can hit sixes.fours better than current Yuvraj' 	2	-1
Yuvraj needs to go. Raina still has value because he is a brilliant fielder, while Yuvraj isn't. Definitely not anymore, at least. Bring in Rahane for Yuvraj as the batting won't suffer, but at least there will be more added on the field." 	4	-1
India has somehow managed to semis? India has arguably one of the best bowling units and much credit goes to them. India still deserved to be in Semis for having such a gutsy bowling unit. We often forget about them. Don't we?" 	2	-2

Amir is a test cricket level player and rohit is a T20 level. Can Rohit make to India Test 11 is a big question mark when technically good players like Pujara and vijay r present. Personally I wish Amir a brilliant test career as he is capable of doing that.....Fm BD' 	2	-1
I wish Rohit would have scored some runs like Kohli did. In that case, I would be more inclined to listen to him instead of what Kohli said' 	2	-1

@take-it-easy, I wish you would have asked your hero Rohit the same question after getting blown on the leg on the first ball and then getting officially out on the second one. The average bowler amazed the below par cement pitch and 60 meter boundary batsman. Isn't it? Was Rohit the highest scorer in any world tournament or even in IPL? The answer is BIG NO too :)" 	3	-1
Shami IS FIT.Latest News. Pandya should get replaced by SHAMI. Pandya cannot bowl in death,nor in power plays nor he can bowl more than 1-2 overs against good opposition's. Shami should replace him immediately." 	2	-3

Best batsman in world (kholi) has said amir is a world class bowler.. Rohit just looks upset.. :-) stats is not even everything.. Specially when taking about a bowler in t20..

Right after his arguments about amir that no one should talk about amir, he needs to do much more etc, he started talking about Bumrah. wont same logic applies for him? needs to do more and consistent? and arent other 4 bowlers doing well for india? I would take Kohli's and Dhonis words than Rohits. because Msd is greatest captain and Kohli is one of the great batsmen. Amir isnt only praised by Kohli, Dhoni or Pakistani players, he has been praised by many all over the world. is Rohit trying to say that he is better than others to talk?" 	3	-3

Lets call a spade a spade guys... its like shahid afridi saying that Kohli is a normal player and the real find is Sarfaraz.. respect the modern day greats even though i always root against Kohli but his batting is too good to deny the fact that he is an all time great. Same is the case with Amir, dont hate just because he belongs to Pakistan. Love the game, Respect the players!!' 	4	-2

Well, Sharma is right! Finding a world class bowler in Pakistan is very 'normal' and finding a real bowler in India is definitely 'rare'. Sharma is right!" 	1	-1
Well, I understand the anti-Rohit comments here but actually he is not totally off the mark. Truth is, it is very early days for Amir and batsman have seen little of him thus far. Let's see how he evolves. Media always likes to create a big hype around something that could be. Bumrah also has shown potential. While Bumrah's addition has lifted Team India's spirits the inclusion of Amir seems to have deflated his Pak team-mates. Lot of people tended to criticize the great SRT for not winning matches for India when India's bowlers at most times were virtually incapable of bowling out opposition twice! Now Amir is a bowler and how many matches did Pak win???" 	3	-2
@electric_loco, since when did Rohit started to play for pakistan? just wondering coz u said our Rohit?.' 	1	-1
Our Rohit is also just a 'normal' player. But ,obviously a tad over-hyped due to his perceived 'talent'. But ,yes he's good,great even on his day-on flat pitches. But not always,not on 'all kind of pitches'." 	3	-1
Guys, please know the reason behind the hype. Aamer is a proven bowler, of the current Pakistan team he has played abroad more than any player with the exception of Misbah and Younus Khan. Hence the world is looking forward to his return, also both Aamer and Wahab in my personal opinion are test bowlers, Aamer has a good record in tests whereas Bumra has only played a few T20's, Rohit is right in saying Aamer needs to show consistency but the same applies for Bumra and himself of course. My making over the top statements like this he is just making himself look silly and upset at the fact that his team had trouble playing Aamer." 	2	-3
Aamir is a normal bowler and good for only favourable condition??? Pardon me guys the same implies on Rohit as I have never seen him batting well on swinging pitches. He is also scored on flat tracks unlike Virat Kohli. I have no doubt that Rohit will score against good bowlers even Aamir on flat tracks in his home ground as he use to do for years and if Aamir is not good enough then Rohit is even worse...' 	2	-3
Wasim Akram is my favourite bowler followed by Mcgrath &amp; Ambrose...I like to include all these three bowlers in my playing eleven...Akram is the only bowler who knew to bowl six different balls in one over...Pak is fortunate to have such greatest bowler (just like SRT for India)...but I doubt that Aamir belongs to this league (although it is very early to say)...Rohit is right &amp; i want to see how he faces Aamir in this T20 WC...Rohit is the only player now who pulls the ball in both front foot &amp; back foot positions (Smith is the good puller of the ball in back foot position like Ponting &amp; SRT)...can he utilise this technique against Aamir &amp; co...' 	3	-2
Well what he said is right.  Aamir bowled a great first couple of overs in that game. But he couldn't repeat it in any other games.  1 good spell does not define a bowler. Irfan Pathan once took a hatrick in the first over of a test match with similar bowling, a little lesser pace, and look where he is now!!  No doubt Aamir is a rare talent,  and hope he conquers the world. But miles to go before he can be compared to wasim!!  Bumrah too looks good, but what makes him look better is he was consistent in all the games. But again he has to prove his worth in the long run, I.e. once teams work out his bowling nd action" 	3	-2
bumrah is a good find for india he doesn't need  pitch to play any role for his success but I don't think he will b a player for all formats where as amir can be good in each format ... Rohit shd stop speaking abt this unwanted things n concentrate on his game .. .." 	3	-1
Why people can't digest the success of others? He is right Wahab,Irfan,junaid all are talented but no one can make it swing like aamir, neither they are as consistent and economical as Aamir. Wahab relies on Pace only, for Irfan its bounce, junaid makes it swing only. While Amir has all of these qualities. If Bumrah is rare then Amir is the rarest. and those who think he can't be a waseem, they should watch waseem's bowling when he was 22. There is not much difference, if there is any difference that is in favour of Amir not waseem." 	3	-1
my favourite of alll......' 	2	-1
thats true, we should speak of pearls of our necklace...but no doubt Amir is a wonderful bowler...have some talent similar to wasim akram ....but has to prove a lot to get near to that legend of immense calibre...wasim was a person with six different deliveries that can trouble any batsman...' 	3	-2

Well he's half right and half wrong. Surely Amir is not the best bowler in the world today as all Pakhistanis claim. And surely Bumrah is not half as good as Amir. He has a future quite similar to Nehra or B Kumar." 	2	-2
Rohit is an ordinary test batsman and on a good bowling pitch..he might be very dangerous on flat pitches though. He faced only 2 deliveries from Amir and was out on both..when did the last time any Indian bowler has bowled such fiery spell..swinging at 145  kmph. I believe Amir lost around 200 wickets in last 5 years and he is as good as he was then. I would like Amir to fail in every India match but succeed in other matches as we need such world class bowlers in modern batsman-era game where only handful of such bowlers are left now.' 	3	-3
Only difference between Bumrah' 	1	-1
However, I agree it still too early to compare him with the legendary "Sultan of Swing" Wasim. Wasim had the ability to make the ball talk in any condition along with a toe crushing, swinging yorkers !! I hope Amir continues his journey to greatness, makes India vs Pakistan matches very exciting.' 	4	-2

well looks like rohit is totally feeling pressure of facing aamir again so he is trying to get the pressure shifted by stating aamir as normal bowler its not a game or over that makes a bowler great but his attitude i saw aamir in asia cup he learnt his mistake of bowling noball and he is bowling with great commitment i agree with virat kohli that aamir is great bowling option and he will one day become one of the great fast bowler and regarding rohit comment aamir need not think about it and make his swing talk' 	3	-2
