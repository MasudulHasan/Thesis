"There are two RPC calls to be made to download artifacts  download  and  wait_for_status . Sync means that you can use that artifact after  download  has returned. Async means that you must wait until  wait_for_status  has returned. This is done so that we can start kicking off a suite run before we fully finish downloading everything we might need.	1	-2
The  download  call happens as part of the RPC call that's made to autotest to kick off a suite. The  wait_for_status  RPC call is made as part of dynamic_suite code (see dynamic_suite.py:450). By the time you'd be kicking off your firmware test it would be assured that the firmware tarball would be downloaded. Therefore, I would think it should be fine/safe to make this async."	1	-2

I don't see the need for this change. If you built with the ebuild unmodified, you'd get an image.bin which would be what you want. As far as I could tell looking at the new function, it's identical to the old one except that you're leaving out the original image.bin.	1	-1
The difference between image.bin and image.rw.bin is that cros_bundle_firmware is being passed the --force-rw option in one case and not in the other. What that does is it changes the way parts of the image are put together so that vboot doesn't allow the RO only optimization even if the RO firmware claims it supports it.	1	-2
The RO only optimization is where you run the whole firmware out of RO instead of jumping into an RW copy partway through. If you really don't want to enable that optimization, you can not pass that flag to vboot when running VbInit.	1	-1
Even if you do want to split things out like this, it would be better to take the existing depthcharge function and to selectively build the RO image based on a use flag.	1	-1
Independent of whether splitting things up is a good idea, if Mike (who knows bash much better than I do, I think) likes the style of the new function you've made, it would be nice to incorporate the style changes back into the original function."	1	-1

The error handling is fine, but the message doesn't mention bootstage so it isn't clear where the failure is. I think you should fix that.	1	-1
set_bootstage_prop is called twice with the same path. In both cases it calls fdt_path_offset() to get the offset. You may as well just call it once here, immediately after your strncat below.	1	-1
Then you set_bootstage_prop can be passed a node. In fact this function just has a call to fdt_setprop() so why have it at all? Just call fdt_setprop_cell or fdt_setprop_string instead, which are better suited to your requirements anyway	1	-1
Re working_fdt, I do prefer a single reference to a global rather than multiple spread throughout the file, but if you remove the function then this is not an issue anyway, I think that the whole of this for() loop should be in a separate function called from bootstage_report() if working_fdt is not 0.

Currently the behavior of the permissions system (TCEmain and thus also all other components) is to use ""checkLanguageAccess"" only if the TCA for the table has a ""languageField"".	1	-1
""pages"" is not such a table, because there is ""pages_language_overlay"". So the current integrators solution to restrict a user not to be able to edit the ""Original Language"" is to remove the permissions for editing table ""pages"" and only allow ""pages_language_overlay"". See also http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27794	1	-2
This is not what is being done in the patch, but instead you simply check for checkLanguageAccess.	1	-1
Similar problem we have in the ""List view"", as the context menu provides more options (i.e. for content elements) than really permitted. Permission check in TCEmain is more ""aggressive"" than in the GUI.	1	-2

The indexer usage was not changed, it just fixes the bug and it works. :) Adapting to the new indexer is yet another task, of course."	1	-2
I know - but maybe it would make sense to correct it right away instead of creating a separate bug report which doubles or triples the effort to get it done...	1	-2

I have a separate TYPO3 installation running in an alias on the main site - that is in /home/. So domain.com is one TYPO3 installation and /home/ is a separate one using alias in Apache.	1	-1
This works fine given that config.absRefPrefix is set to http://domain.com/home/	1	-1
The automatically created JS and CSS has the filename http://domain.com/typo3temp/.... in the compressor. So conceptually it is actually not an external CSS/JS, but because of the absRefPrefix - TYPO3 think it is external.	1	-1

Rebased on master. The changes introduced come from I076a02096fb62bb1b8a51d888287d68c6ca26965, which was merged after the ""security"" topic was rebased, reviewed and verified by Robert.	1	-1

To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors. IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning.	1	-1
Bjrn and Philipp, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that. We were discussing the ""patch for a patch rule"" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think).	1	-1
Please don't treat this as harsh words, I just want to make you aware of the fact that motivating every new contributor is very important for us, and hopefully also for you as an essential part of the TYPO3 community.	1	-2
Thanks for your support!	1	-1

P.S: The reason, why Jenkins fails is probably, because of the parent commit is very old and the patch has to be rebased. Will try to get this done now (if network connection allows)"	1	-1
