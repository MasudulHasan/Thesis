Definitely not a winning combo. Just a bat second winner. When batting first this team will again struggle. Lose two wickets inside powerplay, eat up as many deliveries you can and then hope for some tailender onslaught to get to a 140 score and then lose the match comfortably saying we didn't bat well. There should be a plan for every Four overs of the match. Guptill can be a maxwell but tough to accommodate unless you bring in nathu singh for southee or mitch.

2 overseas bowlers/5 specialist bowlers is a very good approach for MI as McClenhagen and Southee can hit few sixes too if required and also Harbhajan which leaves them with 10 six hitters in the team out off 11 (except Bumrah).
No other team has as many big hitters in the playing 11, although RCB has the best of the lot.

Baffling. Why play Southee and Mc in the same XI. The conditions in which they deserve their respective place in the team are mutually exclusive. It's highly likely that Parthiv is playing largely because of his keeping, given Buttler is dubious while keeping to spin. Otherwise, bringing in some more power in place of Parthiv, viz Nitesh Rana might be useful. MI should drop one of the foreign pacers and bring in Corey Anderson.  In this tournament, given chasing teams are doing substantially better, it would make sense to beef up the batting, given anything under-200 is a bad goal. Better for a side like MI to stock up well on batting and go gung-ho from ball one. Parthiv, Rohit, Rayudu, Buttler, Anderson, Pollard, Hardik, Krunal, Bhajji, Southee/Mitch, Bumrah.

@NEEDGREENPITCHES4BOWLINGALLROUNDERS: I kind of agree with Anand Palwankar that Rohit is the better (or more 'level-headed') captain than Virat, at least in T20s. Getting your team to the playoffs after starting the season with 0-5 (2014) and winning the title after 0-4 (2015) is by no small means because of Rohit's leadership. Starc is out this season, but he played for RCB two seasons prior to that. How many times did RCB win the title then?

@Anand Palwankar by your argument Gambhir would be best of lot . He is even capable and consistent opener and plays most of his home games on sluggish Kolkata pitch when compared to both Rohit and Virat who play in batting paradises :). Having a good bowling attack is a liberty to captain and helps him solve bowling problem easily. Gambhir has best bowling attack of the 3. Rohit has best bowling attack compared to Virat. There is no way Rohit's captaincy can be measured against Virat with bowling attack he is carrying. Starc n Badree out of IPL . RCB is going to blow lot of high scoring games cos of class of bowling. There main weapon in bowling is retired allrounder Watson who was never a spearhead. Rohit has 2 new zealanders and Bhajji who can be handful based on conditions. Death overs and powerplay overs and middle overs are in cruise control for Rohit /MI think tank. RCB fails in that regard year after year so does captaincy and rotation of bowlers.

I agree with sudimagge. Except for one game, all teams batting second seem to be winning the match. As soon as someone loses the toss, that teams lost the game. Don't even need to watch the whole match. Just for the meaningless slog-fest that don't make a tad bit if difference in the end. And how disappointing the RCB with its star-studded cast seems to be at the moment. Please improve pitches where the toss doesn't decide the fate of the team.

Again and again it's prooving Rohit is a best leadership qualities than Virat. People always making mistake to understand difference between a good player and a good leader. Today Virat riding on everything due to his big batting abilities. But when particular time comes when your leadership qualities are tested, Virat always fumbles. There are so many examples in past we have seen, it's not nessessory that good batsman should be a good leader. We saw Mike Briarly, Clive Lloyd, Ian Chapple etc etc... Vivian Richard, Ian Botham were couldnt do much as a leader. Virat is the best batsman we have after Sachin. But since last few years we are watching Rohit is doing much better as a leader than Virat. Last both IPL titles for MI had big impact of Rohits leadership. Remember last years last league match of MI against KKR. Rohit brought Pollard in last over and proved master strok. Yesterday when Rohit was taking RCB bowlers, frustration was clearly seen on Virats face. Rohit..better leader.

That is what MI are capable of. They can chase any target on their day. They have 10 batsman who can hit sixes.
Not playing Watson as opener is big mistake, Imagine what a combination Watson and Gayle can be.

Under pressure, Virat loses his cool as a captain. His bowling changes, field settings go awry the moment there's a counter punch from the opposition. A wicket where faster bowlers go for runs, picking Aaron makes little sense, especially when Aaron is not known to be a thinking bowler.  Sreenath Arvind, who has a great strike rate should be an automatic choice. In the absence of Gayle, Watson should open as he has seen a lot of success earlier in that position.

Hardhik and Krunal Pandya are both average at the best. They will have good performances every now and again but there is nothing outstanding about either of them except an air of arrogance and exuberant celebrations. They both seem overawed by the bigger stage and the rawness and immaturity shines through. I have read about the long and hard road of these brother to get here and their desire to emulate the Pathan brothers so credit has to be given to them for what they have achieved thus far...

Pathetic bowling and team selection.  Aaron in the team is a liability. His 19 run over provided the momentum for the MI . aaron and patel should be out . Looks like even if we include 8 bowlers we will not win.  We still havent played RPSG and GL . What  do donald and vettori discuss with bowlers ?  We don have bowlers who can pick wickets in first 6 overs and this has been true for all seasons .  Such worst team management who only concentrate on only batting and dont think anything .  Picking binny and not using his bowling is not accepatable . Kohli field placements are also awful . Even every miss hit were going to vacant boudary line.
</p>
<p>
Mitchell Santner a decent all rounder can be taken as replacement if badree is out of ipl . For starc  certainly replacement is needed may be willey from england . we dont need bowlers who cant pick wickets .

Indian talent except Kohli,sarfaraz is clearly lacking in RCB team .

While the opposition could get intimated by the batting might of RCB, the weak link is the bowling.  Absence of Starc and Badree really hurting them.  No matter how much runs their batsmen score, the opposition would always fancy their chances against this attack.

Dew dew dew- why WI beat India in World T20 semi-final. It was WI that day, or else the fans would have exploded had there been other team in WI's place. Wankhede &amp; Chinnaswamy should push their boundaries back to 70-75 in all dimensions if they dont want dew to affect night games. Or play 4pm games. Its KKR's turn to lift the cup this year(2016) after wins in 2012 &amp; 2014(even no). MI's turn will come next year(2013 &amp; 2015)

Pollard and Buttler, about 4 or 5 year ago combined in the Somerset T20 team to be one of the most feared batting partnerships in England, Somerset seemed to get to a final every year, and these two invented the cool as ice impossible total chase down before it became a norm, at least in county cricket. Nice to see them together again.

Fewer comments....reason I feel is nobody supports any one team as there are so many fmgois players spread across. Comments appear when you have a favourite team. Emotions flow from fans for a win or loss. In Leagues, loyalty of fans shifts

Looks like this is the final eleven and   certainly  the best batting order for MI at least for a few matches.Though I would like to see Guptil and /or Corey at some point, it looks very unlikely considering the restrictions on the number of foreign players.From the beginning I felt Rayudu was the best choice for number three position. He may not be as stylish as Rohit or Virat,but certainly a very good accumulator of runs.Only Butler can come in his place depending on the situation.Good luck MI.

Bad call by Kohli to call Heads instead of Tails when he already have Head in his team.
I think the game got away from RCB at the 5 over mark where Kohli bowled Aaron an extra over which gave away 19 runs. These days as a captain you have to make batsmen guessing by changing bowlers otherwise they set up for the bowler and whack him to all parts. Binny is an excellent out-swinger of the ball and previous season's RR used him most in the Powerplays when ball did a bit.

Fall of one and rise of another seem fit to describe Pandya brothers. Hardik was drafted into the side not long ago with all sorts of comarisons to good current day allrounders, documentaries aired about his fairy tale of finding the pinnacle and limelight, influential binny was sent home but Hardik has lost his aroma too fast. On the other hand his brother looks a much better prospect both with the bat and the ball. Bumrah continues to impress and I hope he will be given an opportunity to perform outside India and pitches will not made placid to support indian batsmen. I am sure Gambhir will make his way to indian side again to add experience on the back of this IPL season. He seems to be more motivated by the downfall of Dhawan.

Ponting genius shines through again. Guptill not playing may have initially had a few people second guessing the decision, but the investment in Pollard comes good. Looks like a settled MI line-up has both Buttler and Pollard so if Guptill wants it, he must push out either Southee or McClenaghan. For Andersons sake i hope MI release him at the end of the year so he can get a gig with a side that would actually benefit from having him

I have no idea why RCB not playing  M.Singh . He played some match-winning performance with the bat. They need to strength bowling department .No point playing Extra batsman . Although T. Head performed well , I will still go for an extra bowler . The main problem is that Chahal looks out of touch . He has not regular at domestic level. S.Binny is of no use . My playing X1 for RCB"
K.L.Rahul V.kohli  Abd  Mandeep Watson Sarfaraz  Rasool Iqbal Badree Adam Aaron. Rasool and Iqbal both handy with bat .  # 3 genuine spinner ... Badree -- one of the best legspinner in T20 . Rasool --- Decent off-spinner Iqbal  -- left arm spin. Adam and Aaron raw pace .Badree and Adam Milne should open the bowling . Watson useful dead overs bowler . Aaron Rasool and Iqbal can bowl in middle over s.

Good move to bring back Pollard in the team . In my opinion, few more changes are required in the team . First Corey Anderson must play . He is one of the best all-rounder in T20 . He is a match winner . Second change is not necessary but they should try it . I would give chance to Chand and Rana in place of Parthiv . K. Pandya has impressed with both bat and ball .
Chand Rohit Anderson Ambati Butler Pollard K.Pandya H.Singh N.singh T.Southee J.Burmah 
H.pandya should be dropped on the current form . Middle order looks strong . Even bowling unit remain almost same . Adding Anderson and extra fast bowler . 4 --- fast bowler 2 --- Spinner . They may try another spinner in place of N.singh depend on upon pitch. H.pandya must be dropped for 2-3 matches . Gl Team mumbai...

A more balanced side chosen by RCB, they should stick with it and results will come their way. Krunal Pandya showing that he is a better player than his highly rated brother, this time with his bowling efforts, taking two important wickets. Mumbai Indians, more sensible having Rohit at opening the batting, he is the best batter in the side.

Mumbai is the strongest team. I m a KKR supporter. RCB, Gujrat are also very strong. MI found the winning formula.. 1) pick a two of very good indian batsmen (Rohit, Raydu). 2) pick a couple of high SR, high average foreign bats (Pollard, Butler). 3) pick an indian spin bowling allrounder (Krunal) 4) Couple of great foriegn pacers (they also bat well) 5) An indian spinner (Harbhajan).  Gujrat did almost the same thing, but they have foreign allrounders as well. KKR's formula of mystery bowler, foreign quick, two foreign allrounders is not bad... bt batting looks thin when KKR has to chase 170+/

Great win for MI, but I'm concerned how much of an impact winning the toss is having on these games. Funny enough that MI has lost both games in which they lost the toss while winning 2/3 on winning the toss (that one loss only because Rohit rather bizarrely chose to bat first).

Unlucky RCB have lost 3 tosses in a row where if they had one they would have easily chased down the totals they were set. I would stick with Richardson and my XI would be
Rahul
Kohli
ABDV
Watson
Head
Sarfaraz
Binny
Patel
Chahal
Abdulla
Richardson

So if we win the toss vs RPS with their bowling and due RCB will win the game but if we lose the toss we will lose definitely unless we score 230

Rishi Dhawan,Hardik Pandya and Stuart Binny all team Indias recent medium pace allrounder's faring bad in IPL.
Rishi not getting a game till now. Binny's second n Harik's 5th game without much success. India n fans are still searching.. Someone to play as allrounder in OZ,NZ,English n SA conditions. Can't assume any of these players warrant a game in Test cricket or ODI.

It's a shame that Southee and Mcclenaghan bowling in the excess of 135 ks and usually over 140 ks are regarded as Right and Left Arm medium fast respectively. It's high time to update the profile of some players don't you think?

KKR missed the trick. I was really surprised not to see Narine in the quad. He should be an automatic choice. I also felt that KKR had a bowler short. I would pick Narine instead of Hogg and Shakib instead of Munro.

With Guptill in MI face a barrier to give a chance for all. Southee can b tried if a pace friendly wicket is there in any next game. Else I believe Corey shud come in. Can bat and ball. Mitch is surety unless he goes bad in this long run. Give 2 game's to Polly and if he doesn't fare well try Guptill. we shouldn't 4gt his contributions in the past and judge by 1 bad show show. Well I see Rohit, Corey/Guptil,  Raydu, Butler, Pollard, Parthiv/nmukth,Pandya, Bhajji,Mitch, Vinay, Bumrah. That makes MI deadly.

@markbrop: Did you forget the manufactured pitches last summer? No bowler had a chance that summer, from either limited-overs series, apart from Starc, who is a phenom in limited-overs cricket. The limited-overs series' were essentially a contest of "my batsmen vs your batsmen", where even awful batsmen scored runs.
</p>
<p>
McClenaghan was awesome when he first came on the scene, then for about a year (around 2014/2015), he dramatically dipped, and dipped hard, though this was in ODIs. He might be back to his best, and if so, he is lethal, and near-unstoppable as he is THAT good. He helped Mumbai win last year's IPL alongside Malinga.

A well developed strategy to chase 188 down to dismantle KKR's spirits. Incredible to see Butler hitting ball so easily. Perfect innings played by Rohit, and McCleneghan just bamboozled KKR with his few dangerous strokes. Well done MI. Now the addition of Guptill would bring more flavor.

Mitch is surety unless he goes bad in this long run. Give 2 game's to Polly and if he doesn't fare well try Guptill. we shouldn't 4gt his contributions in the past and judge by 1 bad show show. Well I see Rohit, Corey/Guptil,  Raydu, Butler, Pollard, Parthiv/nmukth,Pandya, Bhajji,Mitch, Vinay, Bumrah. That makes MI deadly.

Yes PIYUSHD, I liked your idea of start with a super over, or some balls or any other way to decide who has the option to decide whether to bat/field first instead of toss

@markbrop: Did you forget the manufactured pitches last summer? No bowler had a chance that summer, from either limited-overs series, apart from Starc, who is a phenom in limited-overs cricket. The limited-overs series' were essentially a contest of "my batsmen vs your batsmen", where even awful batsmen scored runs.
</p>
<p>
McClenaghan was awesome when he first came on the scene, then for about a year (around 2014/2015), he dramatically dipped, and dipped hard, though this was in ODIs. He might be back to his best, and if so, he is lethal, and near-unstoppable as he is THAT good. He helped Mumbai win last year's IPL alongside Malinga.

A well developed strategy to chase 188 down to dismantle KKR's spirits. Incredible to see Butler hitting ball so easily. Perfect innings played by Rohit, and McCleneghan just bamboozled KKR with his few dangerous strokes. Well done MI. Now the addition of Guptill would bring more flavor.

I was beginning to think Rohit Sharma had lost the ability to bat a decent innings but this captains knock is a timely reminder, of what a very good quality opening batsmen Rohit Sharma is. India should look to play Manish Pandey and Rohit Sharma as Indian openers in international T20 and ODI cricket, Shikhar Dhawan recent form has not been good or show signs of improvement and he is 30. Rohit Sharma had a very mediocre World T20 and i'm sure, other people felt he was loosing the plot as a T20 opener, especially given his last Mumbai Indian innings against Rising Pune Supergiants combined with the form he showed in the recent WT20 tournament.

Phenomenal performance by Mumbai. However, there's still a good scope of improvement in the eleven. Anderson can come in for Polly since he isn't any handy with his bowling and batting these days. Anderson can bowl well and bats better. Mitch McClenaghan and Jos should stay in the 11 and bring in Guppy for Southee. Rotate Indian bowlers per their performance keeping Bumrah and Bhajji intact.

KKR needs Narine in old form if they are to win the title. Russel and Narine should be must, not sure about Hasting in long run as I feel he has been a pretty ordinary quick for Aus, although he has been good for kkr so far. Sakib's inability to power hit is his weak link, Monru is kinda hit and miss player, Hogg as we saw before brilliant in one game and ordinary in another. Among the foreign only Russle looks reliable atm, they badly need Narin the old X factor.

Fantastic innings from Rohit. Class player. As is McClenaghan who has been one of the best white ball bowlers in international cricket since the champions trophy of 2013.
</p>
<p>
Mumbai have an interesting selection dilemma. Do they keep Southee in or go for Guptill, who I still believe is one of the best in the world. I'd also consider them bringing in Anderson for Pollard. Not only is Pollard not fully fit, but Anderson is just a better cricketer. Pollard has a fine IPL record with the bat and is an outstanding fielder. But compare what Anderson and Buttler have done in international cricket to Pollard, and there's no comparison. Anderson also provides a bowling option, and is an excellent fielder. Anderson and Buttler are two of the best finishers in the world, behind AB and maybe Dhoni (who's batting isn't what is was). Pollard hasn't played international cricket in a while, and his international record is far inferior to the other two.

Rohit sharmas innings was actually slow in the middle overs and it was only butlers hits that gave MI the impetus and reduced the deficit between balls left and runs required, which brought MI close. Rohit then hit a few fours right at the end and improved his strike rate. So butler was the man largely responsible for MI victory. This is not something new about Rohit but people miss it often. Amongst others, parthiv patel just doesnt fit in. A score of 23 off 20 balls does not augur well for MI if they play him in other matches. Even pandya has been far from impressive and hasnt shown the form he showed on his debut. It is only the foreign players who seem to be capable of winning matches. I hope MI select some good indian players in future editions of IPL and promote local talent instead of parthiv patel.

MI has won today but still it's not a perfect XI.I have a doubt on the utility of Pandya, after seeing him in the WC T20 &amp; first 2 matches in IPL. Also Pollard is completely out of touch after a long injury. My playing XI will be - Rohit ,Parthiv, Guptil,Butler, Anderson, Rayudu, Harbhajan, Shreyas Gopal, Mcleghanan, Bumrah, Nathu Singh.
Nathu Singh can be a great potential and MI can use him as a new ball bowler along with Corey Anderson &amp; Mclenaghan. Bumrah should bowl with old ball particularly in the end overs.

T20's heavily depend upon toss winning and it's quite unfair to have the toss each time. They can change the rules in a way that each team or pair or other means can decide alternatively and only first time it can be via toss. As an example between India and Australia, have the toss first time, let's say India wins the toss. Second time Australia decide whether to bat/field, then India and son on... They can decide the pairing based upon various factors. That way we more dependent on talent than fortune.

Suddenly KKR seems they can't go the distance.  Only team with big hitters are going to make unless the pitch misbehaves.  KKR does not have one.  The other night RCB was brilliant with the bat, even young Khan was terrific.  While Gambhir scores those 30s and 50s consistently, cannot win matches.  His partner Uthappa cannot score against quality bowling which has been proved time and again.  Seems they have missed the trick this season.  T20 keeps evolving and of late, it is the big hitters who are making impact and KKL does not have one (don't consider Yusuf as one he is out of this league)

They were missing Narine and Shakib, who both excel at Eden Gardens, which is usually a spin-friendly pitch.

<p>
They didn't want to mess up a winning team, and tried to compensate by altering one of the Indian players for a spinner.

<p>
Hope Shakib can get some more game time. He's their good luck charm, they have performed better in the seasons that he's been involved in, except 1. He's never quite  excelled with the bat, in the IPL. 
Perhaps playing him up the order would help.

KKR is in for a long season. I am afraid they do not have enough. They had to let Narine and Ghamvir go and get one of the top players (like Watson, Butler, Mustafiz, Jordan, Amir). Other teams are improving, only reason KKR was a threat was Narine and (Russel as an allrounder). While they have a few good desi batsmen (specially Manish), their top paid players Ghamvir and Narine are not going to be enough. MI's top players like Rohit, Butler, Bumrah, Mcclenghan, Harbhajan played well. These guys(except Harbhajan) are the better players of their national team. Sakib's bowling is no longer as threatening as it used to be(Tamim, MohmadUllah, Shabbir, Taskin, Mustafiz, AlAmin are Bangladesh's top players these days). It was such an easy decision to leave Ghamvir and pick him up again and run for Watson. Then bring in one of the top bowlers of WC (Mustafiz, Amir, Jordan). That would do for KKR. They did not do it.

At one stage what looks like a score of 200 plus ended up scoring 187. Thanks to Gambhir. If a batsman who opens an inning and cannot score at the rate of 2 runs/per ball after he plays 35 balls should give away his wicket and let the others to the power hitting.

On a pitch which has anything in it for bowlers Rohit is a walking wicket but on a flat pitch like this he will be in my team before even Kohli. Is quite a bit like Martin Guptill honestly.This Is not a criticism as Dhawan can't bat on any surface nowadays. He is over the hill and has peaked and cannot perform at this level.India should discard Dhawan.KKR has serious thinking to do because of they can't afford passengers like Yusuf who are soo way past their sell by date that it's hard to fathom they are playing at this level. Narine/Shakib had to be on this pitch. Gambhir also batting slow but at least he is batting unlike Dhawan who cannot last more than 3-4 overs in any format now. Also soon I think SL will be pushed out of full membership and will play with associates. There are more BD players than SL players this season. Embarrassing times for SL team and all over the hill players getting found out at this level.

This is not the first time Bumrah has dropped a sitter.  He blew a few in the WC, notably the one against BD.  He is a clumsy ground fielder too. If having Jonty Rhodes as your fielding coach doesn't help you become a better fielder, there are very few other miracles left to save you from regular humiliation in the feild.  I can see him juggle, slip and drop a few semifinals/finals for India through his butterfingers.

Well done Mumbai Indians (Rohit* and Buttler) !!! KKR made a huge blunder leaving out Sunil Narine and Shakib Al Hassan. Mind you, Mumbai have many right handers and Shakib could have made a difference. Anyway, KKR will now surely change their team for next game and that's good for the tournament. We will get to see all players in action and that can only be exciting.

I do not get why KKR is benching Shakib. Is he injured? He is a better bowler than Hoggy was even in Hogg's prime. He is a better batsman than Munro. And quite an adept fielder. And then they are ignoring Chris Lynn, the best batsman of the BBL.

Poor selection by KKR, TOOTHLESS bowling. Brad Hogg playing a good match doesnt mean he will win you all matches and play like that whole season. After all, he is an old player, WAY past his prime form. Leaving out Shakib, Narine while taking in Hastings, Hogg, Russel, was a POOR choice.
Narine must be given a chance to see if his bowling has that juice anymore while Shakib (Batting + Bowling ) must play instead of one of Hastings(bowling), Hogg(bowling), Russel(bowl+bat). Maybe Morkel could be tried too
This current xi wont bring trophy.

KKR fell short by 25-30 runs in the end. Ind fans will get to see the impact of Butler. His innings won the match for MI more than Rohit's.

Wonder what's so wrong with Southee. Seems to have lost form in all three formats. No swing, no bounce. Hope Bondy has a quite word with him.

I think it is better to replace Dhawan with Rahane to open with Rohit. I hope Ro will be in good form in his home ground. As far as Yuvi's replacement is concerned I think it is better to go with Pandey who is known for his batting skill. We need more runs if we are batting first and we need the same if we are chasing.

About Dhawan, "Since then, he has made 1, 6, 23 and 13. He hasn't looked out of touch, and has timed the ball brilliantly at times". How many brilliant shots could he have hit in those 43 runs in 4 innings, two of which are only 1 and 6. I have said before, Dhawan scores one innings of some substance once every 10-12 innings. So, his next big one will come after another 5-6 innings from now. Ind should bring Rahane or any other batsman for that matter in place of Dhawan. It can't be worse than having Dhawan.

It is so sad to see a batsman of Rahane's caliber being wasted by the team management . Look at people like Amla , Root , Williamson . Rahane could very well do the same job for us like they are doing for their team . If only our captain could think a little logically . Dhawan is a lottery at best and his consistency as an opener is worst among all teams . Nohit is a makeshift opener with the technique and hitting skills of a middle order batsman .  I wonder how come the so called think tank cannot make place for Rahane when 4 out of their top 5 is struggling like this . Wouldn't be surprised if we are beaten by West Indies easily .

The worry is that law of averages should not catch up King Kholi.  The openers have to fir and play like Roy or Guptil or Munroe, without caring for their wicket. Then score can become 160+ which will make a world of difference. Pandya cannot always deliver on the 20th over.  His 10 runs of last two balls would have cost us the match against Aussies. Try Harbajan. Replace Dhawan with Rahane &amp; Bhajji for Yuvi.

The obvious change seems to elude the Team Mgmt. ROHIT is not an opener, and was in fact one of the best upcoming T20 middle-order/ finishers in the IPL a couple of years ago. Get him at #4....he'd be great smashing it around in the last 5 overs! RAHANE has been the most consistent Opener through IPLs. He's got the technique and is a fast scorer as an opener. RAINA is a great team man and deserves a place with his experience...but #5 or #6 (swapped with Dhoni).

Everyone seems to be focussing on Raina, Yuvraj and Dhawan ignoring a completely underwhelming Rohit Sharma who has flattered to deceive right through this T20 World Championship. For someone who has been rated 'talented' time and over again, he has time and again been guilty of throwing his wicket away putting immense pressure on Virat and the middle order. Raina for one has contributed both with the ball and in the fielding department, something that Rohit cannot cannot claim to have done. If anything dropping him out of the team till he understands the meaning of the word consistency is the need of the hour. To come and play two breath taking shots and then surrender his wicket on a platter makes him the most vulnerable player in this squad.

Great choice of words, and twist of phrases, Karthik. Particularly, the ones on Raina.. he does define "chancy". I would love to see Rahane in the team, in Raina's place... to provide some stability in the middle order, should the Law of Averages catch up with Kohli. [I tend to gush every time I write his name..so, will avoid the emotions this one time]. Of course, assuming that.. the Titanic philosophical shift.. from chancy ball belting.. to real cricket shots [T20 is cricket, too, after all.. beyond the circus] happens tonight. Kohli does it with Cricket shots.. doesn't he?!!
And on Yuvraj... the last inning speaks of his mettle.. not just as a cricketer.. but much more. I wish him well.. but not sure.. as you say.. how long he can carry on.. esp given the fact that not all deliveries will come into his comfort slots..
Good Luck India..

Team management wanted to retain the winning 11 (weird logic to carry non-performers)... now Yuvi is out, so the winning combo has to be changed.... at least now can we have horses for the courses selection... the matches are in India, the tracks are turning... can we play 3 spinners... specially knowing that WI and Eng both does not play spin well.... or should I say play faster bowlers more easily....
</p>
<p>
I guess Raina will remain in the team (for reasons still unknown)... at least can Dhoni come up the batting order and Raina come after him, with a license to kill... which probably suits his batting style... we all know he has never been an inning builder...

Here is my solution to win the games. Hope Dhoni and team read it.
</p>
<p>
1. First 5-6 overs, speed up.... letting you know in simple english. see how other successful team score- 15 Run per over is not difficult dudes, nobody is out there to catch you;-) this is 2016, not 1985 guys.learn learn learn.
</p>
<p>
2. if opener's are afraid for #1 above, send someone who doesn't really care to lose his wicket.. send Pandya or Jadeja or Ashwin or someone else. Dhoni, Dhawan and Rohit-- you need to change your mentality. see how England played!! 
</p>
<p>
3. REMOVE Yuvraj-even for final. This is really critical. get chance to someone like Rahane or Negi. 
</p>
<p>
4. Dhoni and boys need to watch tapes/videos to analyse how those other teams who scores 200+ runs and learn &amp; come up with game plan... 
</p>
<p>
5. game plan should not be to keep wickets till the end. Game plan should be to score 200+.Can it be more simpler than that?

@BARUN SHARMA: I already stated that my bet is with Manish Pandey to replace Yuvraj. What will Dhoni &amp; Shastri do is anybody's guess! Dhoni has his own logic which includes Unchanged XI, whether it is balanced or not. In my opinion, Raina is NOT a #4 bat but it is Dhoni's decision. MSD puts Raina there with a vain hope that he can hit any bowling. Rohit &amp; Dhawan fail in 3 out of 4 outings especially when they play world class bowlers on spicy pitches. Both Rahane &amp; Pandey are proper batsmen but they have no chance of getting in XI till Dhoni's unchanged XI has an injury. Now that vacancy has arisen, it is rumoured that he is entertaining the thought of including Negi to replace Yuvraj- a frightening thought when India has 3 out of top 4 bats failing consistently. Is this Indian XI or Dhoni's XI? Has Rationality no place in XI selection?

@Barunsharma : Small trivia for you. Sachin took 78 matches to score his first century.. If anyone had expected instant results from him, we wouldn't have seen Sachin. Give Hardik Pandya time. 50 Odis   T20 Min before coming to a conclusion. And India needs proper 4 batsmen excluding MSD. So including Pandey or Rahane is a clear selection choice. I fear MSD and Ravi Shastri will select Negi expecting him to score a quick fire 20 25. What if situation requires consolidation over explosiveness.. Logical choice is to include Pandey or Rahane in place of Yuvraj.

@Nampally "India has 3 more all rounders in Jadeja, Pandya &amp; Ashwin" on paper yeah but in reality Jadeja is worse batsmen of them all in T20I's. Ashwin at best strikes at 100 S/R which is no good for late order hitter. So his position as a allrounder is also not discounted in batting order. Now its only left to Pandya who is more suited to order of his batting. For me Yuvi @ 5 was a big hit if you consider match situations. Dhoni cleverly sends Yuvi for consolidation which he is doing aplomb. Yuvi did fail in Accelerating . Now about Raina only good innings he had after long time was against Bangla that too he couldn't build on it. Being in Bangalore where ground size should help Raina for his lofted shots this was his best shot to come back to form against supposedly weaker bowling he did top score but was edgy at his best. Rohit is still living in his past glory and was making sure India score less then 30 against OZ (17 b 12 runs) . Shikhar always looks in form n gets OUT in WC!

@Nampally You assume things a lot. Suresh Raina was power hitter earlier because he used to bat down the order earlier. The same was the case with Yuvraj. When someone coming at batting order 3 and 4, what their role should be to stabilize team and provide momentum for the final push during last overs. Nowadays, Role of Raina and Yuvi are different and don't expect them to play power hitters all the time but yes, It is expected the role of power hitters from Jadeja, Pandya and others who bat down the order. Raina definitely failed in his new role but I don't agree with Yuvi. He always delivered when India needed except one or two fails. I have a lot doubt with Rahane. After given so many opportunities, he couldn't prove that he is really a T20 player. Definitely, he is a very good batsman for Test and ODIs but T20 isn't meant for him. I will pick Manish Pandey ahead of him in T20 anytime.

India has been playing Raina &amp; Yuvraj as power hitting all rounders. But both have performed below par &amp; have become more or less as "Utility" players. India has 3 more all rounders in Jadeja, Pandya &amp; Ashwin who follow. When a team is packed with too many half baked all rounders it is difficult to have either a strong bowling or batting. Kohli is the "One-Man" batting who has literally carried India into the Semi Final, at least in batting. India needed someone like Rahane or Pandey to strengthen their batting at #4. Raina, as free swinger, is at best a #6 bat NOT #4.Dhoni wants to bat at #6 rather than #4.Despite missing #4, India somehow managed to reach the Semi. Now Yuvraj out with injury, India needs a specialist bat @#4. My bet is it will be Manish Pandey who gets the nod. Thought of including Negi is infantile &amp; hope Dhoni will not entertain it. India needs production from all top 4 bats not Just Kohli. That is the need of the hour.

"They have kept their faith in Raina. Neither has rewarded that faith, just yet." - what a load of non-sense. Not long ago (how long was that, perhaps a month?) Raina played a match winning innings in that 3rd T20 against Australia. Unfortunately for us, four of our batsmen are not in great form. What will happen if replace all of them at once? - it's anybody's guess. I am glad Dhoni's thinking process is not the same.

Dhawan and Raina have been horrid and need to go. Yuvraj is different. He had been playing sensibly even though he is out of form. When he comes into his own its different ball game.

@RIP_TESTCRICKET I am really sorry. I am watching all India T20 matches since Aussie series and I have seen Pandya playing as allrounder only managed one good knocks against weak Bangladesh team. His stats itself explain all : 15matches, 	78runs	31heighest	11.14 average. Where does he stands in the category of best batsman. Sorry, I don't agree. Most of the time, I have seen getting out silly either on duck or hitting silly on long on. If he is the standard of a good batsman, India should need to do soul search for really good player otherwise, India will be like another Pak team.

knowing dhonis style of management I don't see any drastic changes. Raina , Dhawan and yuvraj in that order have been mediocre.  People are being sentimental about yuvraj than using logic. He is trying hard but he does not have the ability to change game like he has done in past. India would have lost to aussies if he had continued

why people talking about Harbhajan? how he played in overall matches, and how many times won man of the match compared to the all spinners from all over the world, it is not an achievement, its below average,  I see him most of the time will go sleep during fielding and batting, only he encourages active shouting during his quota of overs.  mostly will go asleep when running between the wickets, or in the pitch while on batting like old days WV Raman,

Yuvraj has played two crucial knocks in this WC. He not only stemmed the flow of wickets but had good partnership with Kohli in the matches against Pakistan and Australia. People who doesn't understand the importance of these knocks know nothing about cricket.
The author may have great expectations from Yuvraj but I feel what Yuvraj has done was the need of the hour.

People talks a lot about top 4 failures out of top 5. I think, Yuvi did his job fair enough. He ensured good partnership with Kohli whenever Indian team needed to build partnership. Purpose of middle order isn't to hit only with good strike rate. We will miss Yuvi definitely. He bowling against Australia was very very critical. One player always missed scrutiny and that is no other but Hardik Pandya. I haven't seen any Substantial batting from his end except few spark here and there. His fielding is good but bowling is so so average. On what expense, he should play in team? Most of pitches are spin friendly and we need another spin bowler than Hardik Pandya. If its pace bowling friendly pitch,  Bhuvnesh Kumar is better bowler and better batsman tham him. Why people not talking about his performance? He is newcomer and if he won't prove himself now then when?

Now the team.. Rahane, Nohit, Kohli, Pandey, Dhoni, Pandya, Jadeja, Ashwin, Bhajji, Nehra, Bumrah. This is the best team available.

@TRUE-CRICKET_LOVER, well said! We're not interested in consistent and fighting cricketers. All we want is the flashy ones. They almost calibrate their game so as to fire (or is it misfire, considering not firing is their normal mode!) once in 8-10 games and retain their spot for the next 10. The problem with Rahane is that he seems to understand cricket and shots/defense better than some of the others. If he'd been equally ignorant, he would've got the nod!
</p>
<p>
I just don't understand how such consistent inconsistency can be rewarded. It's almost as if India is waiting for the law-of-averages to catch up with these guys (in the reverse sense!) so that even they just can't help scoring eventually. 
</p>
<p>
Like fate is saying, 'Okay, enough is enough! I will take things into my hands and make them score at least now'.
</p>
<p>
Rather funny, I dare say.

People are discussing like-for-like replacement for Yuvraj, like Negi, discussing an attractive stroke player (but not allrounder) Manish, they are even discussing a classiical and adaptive top order bat like Rahane, but no one is seeing what the surface has to offer (flat), what type of opponent in place (Gayle is more than half the WI batting) and our own, unused as it may seem, lineup beyond the top 5 (No.6 Dhoni, 7 Jadeja 8 Pandya, 9 Ashwin all of whom are attractive to decent bats) that can manage at least last few overs.
So I am begging that considering all other factors, we strongly need Harbhajan's experience to come in. With Yuvraj and Nehra coming back, the team revived itself, and now, as an additional counter against the rampaging Gayle, we need to have Bhajji. And he is no mug with the bat. If he comes in, he will perhaps bat at No.8 with No.6-8 moving one position higher. Dhoni can easily bat at No.5 having batted at 4 in the past. So Bhajji for Yuvi on Wankhede, anyone?

India's recipe for victories, chasing, in Asia Cup and WCT20 2016. 
Dhawan and Rohit Hit one four/Six and out by 5th over
Raina starts aggressively and spoons an easy catch within 2-3 overs.
Kohli and Yuvi build partnership where Yuvi is just buying time, then goes out by 15th over making around 15-20 runs.
Dhoni comes in and hammers bowlers with Kohli to take India closer.
Dhoni hits the winning boundary.

Yuvraj will miss out and Manish Pandey will play for sure. No problem with the batting. There were few rank turners and some poor shots behind the unsuccessful Indian top order. All of them will score runs on Wankhede's flat track. One problem that India will now face is that there will be no Yuvraj who could have bowled 1 or 2 overs. India will have 5 options and Raina. No support from pitch means Pandya and Nehra going for runs. India can play Negi or Harbhajan in place of Pandya because West Indies look vulnerable against spin.

If we go through the stats Rahane is the most consistent batsman in IPL in the last three years, he hold on to that Orange cap for longer duration too. But he couldn't find a spot in the team. Alas, it is Indian Cricket boss we all want wannabes and flashy ones who would be match winners in a day but that day comes once or twice in a Year or it's already gone. This management is making Rahane another Rahul Dravid for the sake of unworthy ones...

Ive also seen critical of ashish Nehra. He has been one of the best pacers in this tournament after mustafizur and has been delivering consistently with the new ball. I believe he still has 1-2 years and he can retire peacefully after next years champions trophy when india has a new pacer of his capability.

@sandy_bangalore Yuvraj Singh has not played any scratchy innings( although he shouldve retired hurt in the game vs Aus) he has played According to the situation, what the situation demands. Dont forget that when no player Except Kohli could even get bat on ball against pak in asia cup, he played the supporting role. Only a matter of time before he is back in ODI side and rahane Loses his spot. He will Continue to play T20 till 2020 WT20 at least, he still has it in him. Please publish

I think some fans are obsessed to keep Raina out. He is to be in team because of his fielding/Bowling is needed and hasn't batted too bad unlike Selfish Rohit Sharma.
Raina just does as per need, forget technical things in T20 or how he faces a bouncer. What about Rohit who is so technical/talented but seems to consume 15-16 balls and then may be,  starts hitting but if he fails (most often), then team has lost 3 overs in power play. This puts pressure on Dhavan who is a free flow batsmen and also has less patience. If any body to be droped its 1)Rohit,2) Dhavan Yuvraj if unfit. I think Time to bring in Harbhajan and send Ashwin and pinch hitter opener. Or Rohit should be told to hit from ball one like 3 overs 45 Runs not 20-22.

Yuvraj is the best batsman among team after Kohli. If you are good cricket analyst Yuvraj had stopped India from loosing in two matches even in the last match also. Don't you guys don't know cricket. Even though hitting the ball is T20 format it alone will not win the games. Some good partnership should be their in middle order to win the game. Because Yuvraj stood their till 15th over only then they were able to hit and win in the last overs. For suppose if Yuvraj is out for 1 or 2 runs. There are 90 % of chances India might have lost because of pressure. That was the boost given by Yuvraj to his team.  There are lot of mind games going on in the team for captaincy and in that mind games Yuvraj is the sufferer......

There are lot of mind games going on in the team for captaincy and in that mind games Yuvraj is the sufferer......

Same eleven would be always better, it is psychological advantage for Kohli and Dhoni, and this is what dhoni follows. it is like doctors prescription to the patient,  if top three performs, and down three won't make an notified impact , because it won't fir perfect for kohli to courage to perform well. balance is not about the skill alone. it is all about the mind with team commitments.

Dhawan is an ever struggling cricketer... never saw him in a kind of form where he makes consistent runs.
</p>
<p>
India used to have best opening batsmen in the world, but in past couple of years, we have one of the worst averages for opening partnerships.
</p>
<p>
Rohit has scored in recent past (2016) but Dhawan has done it very very rarely... and if prudent practices are employed, one of them would be shown the door after the World cup...
</p>
<p>
Raina is a mysterious case, somehow he finds place in every team.... probably closeness to the captain has something to do with it....
</p>
<p>
Yuvi is someone who looks well beyond his golden days, the striking capabilities are not the same as they used to be... bowling is still a weapon... but a decision is to be made, if the team needs this version of Yuvi..
</p>
<p>
But is this the right time to make any changes ?
</p>
<p>
That would depend on the bench strength, which suggest only Rahane can come in for Dhawan at the moment.... we simply dont have replacements for the middle order

Yuvi is playing good and always played in the important game recently and made important partnership with Kohli. Till now India did not get Flat pitch, According to that, I rate yuvi performance after Kohli, He controlled few games with Kohli....
Bad time for Dhawan and Rohit, Raina need rest........for couple of game.....may be after world cup

I fully agree with the author of this article. Batting used to be India's strength, but it is now India's weakness. There are other areas of weaknesses too. India's bowling is not very threatening to the opposition. There was a time when Indian spinners were the best, but not any more. Are they capable of raising the level of their game and win the World Cup? It is possible.

Both Raina and Yuvraj deserve to be dropped. Yuvraj is a old warhorse now and Raina seems to score only when playing in IPL. This tournament is likely to be the last for both.

Knowing Dhoni, he would absolutely minimize changes in the team given that they have been winning (somehow!). He is unlikely to drop Raina, even though Raina has been the worst batsmen of all sides in this tournament. There is a case for Dhawan being replaced by Rahane, but I doubt if Dhoni will do that (unfortunately, Rahane himself has been desperately poor in many of the recent matches). He is unlikely to drop Rohit because of his phenomenal past record against WI and AU on flat pitches. That leaves, only one change feasible - Negi replacing Yuvraj in case the latter is unfit on Thursday. So in summary, India's failing batsmen will keep their places in the side and have to deliver in the upcoming knock out matches or the team will be under severe pressure.

I like the article. I see a lot of people calling for dropping players. I think the first thing we need to look at is bad form or draining of runs. The difference is bad form is temporary where as draining of runs would be noticed over a long period of time. This is the difference between Raina vs Rohit. Raina is drained of runs, he only has 3 t20 international 50's ever, none since 2010. This last 50 was against Zimbabwe. His last significant innings was Against Australia a 49* that won us the game. There has been a massive decrease in run scoring from this player over the last 3 years. Not many T20i's sides have a number 4 with no half centuries in the last 5 years. Rohit on the other hand has recently improved consistent performances in Australia and a century against South Africa and a match winning 83 against Bangladesh in the Asia cup suggest this player is growing better. In this world cup he could be going through bad form. Don't remove a player due to form on the short run.

Dear Mr Krishnaswamy, 
You are wrong if you think that the likes of Raina and Yuvraj will ever be considered for Rahane, or Pandey,2 guys who have far better technique than these two. Indian sentiments demand that Yuvraj, Raina and a few others, who have made their reputation slogging medium pacers and average spinners in placid pitches all over the world, be picked time and again based on their past reputation and the odd matchwinning innings. In fact, it is absolutely amusing to find the Indian fan going ga-ga over recent scratchy innings of Yuvraj Singh, where he has survived due to sheer luck. Many are still saying that we shouldnt forget 2011, which happened 5 years ago. So these articles are pointless, and people like Yuvraj and Raina, once their careers are done, will hopefully look back and consider how lucky they were to have made their names, reputation, adoring fans in media, and of course millions, in an era of small grounds, heavy bats and average bowling

When dhawan and raina are out of touch, why don't they come to practice on optional net session days with Rahane??
Under performing is alright, can happen with anyone, but the lack of intent to improve, is scary.

Now it's too late to make any change in the team . But if India has to be consistent at the top then non-performers players like Dhawan Yuvi and Raina has to be replaced with Young generation player . IPL format and standard is up to the level . So Why  not the players who are performing in IPL are given chance to play in T2o . On what basis they are selecting the team for T2o . Selectors can select T20 team by watching Ranji performance . Compare the stats of S.Dhawan Yuvi with S.Iyer in last IPl . H.Pandya and J.burmah have already shown us that they can perform at even International level if they have given proper backup and confidence .IF Nehra comeback was possible due to IPl only . India has made the change in the bowling department and the result is there . Why not trying out someone like S.Iyer at the top ? If we are looking for finisher S.yadav and D.Hooda would be the better choice then Yuvi and S.Raina .

As Dhoni said before on Bhuvaneshwar Kumar: With time Bowlers/Batsmen should mature and seek the next level, EG: Ashwin, Jadeja and Kohli: they had their weakness but they worked on their game and reached a status of Respect from the opponents. But Rohith, Dhawan and Raina are still an upset, despite all playing more than 100 international games during a period of over 4-5 years... Bring in Sarfaraz Khan into this team, he has the NOFEAR attitude required for T20 and can bown Leggies and Medium pace as additional attributes...

Difficult call to make. Both Yuvraj and Raina are match winners on their days, but the question is are those days in this World Cup? I guess the advantage both have is that they can bowl handy overs. Yuvraj certainly has bowled some valuable overs. Rahane is the obvious choice to come into the XI, but who would he replace? In my opinion it should be Raina. 
</p>
<p>
Yuvraj has placed some crucial innings, albeit small and shaky but he uses his confidence to ensure he is still there. Raina is a real hit or miss right now, and in my opinion is batting too high at 4, especially because he is having to come in early due to Rohit and Dhawan's poor form. Let Rahane come in. There is no harm in making a chance in a knock out match when you're dropping an out of form player. 
</p>
<p>
I have a feeling however, India won't make a change. It's common throughout many past world cups that they go with the same XI for as long as possible.

If India doesn't drop Dhawan/Rohith on Thursday at Wankhede, and if they lose because of their top order's failure, then still I'm sure this same 15 devoid of Yuvraj (who has played decent in comparison) will be retained... Raina: Maybe we should try changing his jersey colour to yellow... that would be the last attempt :)

With Indian Cricket: It has always been the case that a few get more chances despite the ratio of their success is 1 out of 6 or 7 matches. EG: Rohith has always scored big on Flat trackes, we have not seen him play a fighting innings like how Kohli plays, Shikhar dhawan scores a Hundred at the verge of a Drop, but prior to that for 5,6,7 innings he stays pu in the team with the hope of him scoring big, despite the reason that he gets out playing cheeky... By now Rahane should have been the Mr.Dependable opener who could play his shots up the order and anchor the innings, but Kohli has been doing that as a single guy... If wankhede pitch is flat, Rohith and Dhawan will thrive but that performance will definitely allow them a cushion of 10 more matches... Yuvraj: his body is giving up and better for him to retire and give chance to Manish who is craving up for opportunities before his age dries up...

India will though need to review the team post the world cup. Raina looks out of depth and should make way for someone like Manish Pandey. Yuvraj has played a stellar role in a few matches, his contribution has been immense for India in some of the difficult matches they played against Pakistan and Australia, but clearly his time is over and this could be his swansong. Dhawan always looks in form, but consistency is a challenge. Rohit Sharma clearly is a king on flat tracks, but you dish out difficult tracks to him - pace, bounce, swing, spin and high quality bowlers and he is  found out. Temperament is a challenge with him guess that's why he is not successful in tests. Still he is an asset in the short forms. India needs to explore Manish, Kedar, Shreyas and others post the world cup irrespective of the results.

Dhawan, Rohit, Raina all are match winners. India just need to notable innings in the remaining matches and with the SF being in Mumbai, i am sure one of these can play a matchwinning innings. I would refrain from making any changes in the WC unless Yuvraj gets injured. Manish should then probably replace him, Rahane suits more as an opener. India is currently winning owing to Kohli's batting, the immense contribution from their bowling and fielding and Dhoni's astute captaincy. Beauty of T20 cricket is that one player can carry most of the team and still win the match, which Kohli is doing via his batting. India must thank their fortune that they have Nehra &amp; Bumrah who have turned around India's bowling stocks immensely, its pretty unbelievable that two months back no one would have seen them as being India's bowling spearhead in the WC. With all the batting frailties, India still look favorites because of Kohli's hunger &amp; because of the fact that Dhoni likes to write his own script.

I think its unfair to include Yuvi here, sometimes only the number of runs do not matter...Yuvi has played 2 crucial innings and stayed giving support to Kohli who has been batting as if on another planet. Yuvi's contribution pales only because of what he is capable of, we are so used to see him blast the opposition out day in and day out that a strike rate of 110 plus on testing wickets is being questioned, which I feel is unfair...those few 20s he made were important innings....Raina is clearly the black sheet along with Dhawan...both seem to do well when the ball is not moving and pitch is not bowler friendly..which is where Dhoni's persistence theory may hurt India bad..In manish pandey and Rahane they have two thoroughly deserving people waiting, it is as if dhoni would feel vindicated if raina dhawan would make one 30-40 in 10 matches, which manish and rahane can as well do..dhoni really needs to show a bit more flexibility..we havent been best team, but we havent been worst !!!!

The only possibility for a replacement is if Yuvraj is not fit. In that case MSD might play Pandey as a lower order batsman as Rahane can play only in top 3. Negi might not play as Rohit, Shikar, and Raina are not in form. Had the openers been if form, Negi can replace Yuvraj and come in at 4 and try to smash it. So that Raina can play down the order. But that won't happen. Instead if Yuvi is not fit Pandey will get a game. A bowling option will be lost.Shikar and Rohit are not consistent and don't bowl. Pandey and Rahane might be similar and not huge hitters and won't bowl. Raina and Yuvraj can bowl and filed but don't bat well.

God only knows how Rohit gets so many chances that equal to Dhawan and only Dhawan gets all the beating not Nohit!! First of all, why is he allowing Dot balls in T20. If you cannot hit all the balls out of park, agreed, can you not rotate strike. He gives enough confidence to all the bowlers - new or old!!! Bowlers feared to face Sehwag, Sachin / Ganguly/Gambir (on several occassions), but the case with Nohit is, they know that he will eat balls to get to that mood of hitting. So till then, it is benefit to them (may be 10 to 12 dot balls) and then, they will work him out, by inducing him to play some non-sense shots due to pressure of those dot balls, why he made himself.  I also beleive Nohit gets praised by all commentators for his LAZY Elegance, all the Timing he has got playing shots, blah blah blah etc repeatedly, so IND can put up with him eternally for his once in blue moon performance. I also believe all these Non-performers will perform like a Charm once the IPL bell rings!!!

It seems Raina cannot handle 90 miles hr deliveries and specially short balls, he has trouble with spinning wickets and the off spinner has been his night mare. Yvraj has trouble with short pitch balls throughout his career and his reflexes are slowing down also. India has real problem at hand because only Kohli and Dhoni are batting with confidence. Yuvi is playing a balancing act at present but India might need fire works from him like old times and question is.....can he provide that

Yuvi has not done badly, he deserves to be in, if he is fit. The other three need to be pulled up for taking their place for granted- "rash shots don't win matches; learn patience" Secondly, India does not need a big hitter like Pandey at this stage (Hardik, Dhoni, Jaddu can manage that), rather they need someone like Rahane who can play second fiddle to Kohli. Quick loss of wickets has been a problem And Rahane deserves a chance.

MSD is not know for making changes so late in the game. If Yuvi is 80% he will play. Full stop. I don't see Dhawan-Rohit combo broken as MSD has faith in Dhawan who can suddenly up his game in a finals as he usually does. It will be a miracle if Windies don't target Dhawan, Raina and Yuvi with bouncers. It will be aplenty in display and how these three cope up will determine the results. Ash once again will be key and its hard for Jaddu to keep firing all 6 balls on the toes of some of the biggest hitters in the game. To me if Simmons play he along with Russell are the most dangerous and can become nemesis.

Writer is wrong about Yuvraj.

For short term solution, replacing any of these non-performing players won't hurt. If Raina scores 10 runs or Rahane scores 10 runs, what difference does it make?
Long term solution: Selectors need to start kicking out non-performers and get new blood in. If they showed faith and carried their burden all these years even when they were not performing then why can't they do the same for the Young players. Agreed they might fail in the start but after enough chances they can find out who can stay and who cannot. And also Dhawan, Raina, Sharma, Yuvraj will come to know that they cannot take their place in the team for granted

IND's top 5 batsmen except Kohli have struggled in T20WC 2016. They did have good performances in series v AUS &amp; SL. IND did not have a good batting preparation prior to the tournament due to the green tops at Asia Cup. Based on overall performances in the T20WC degree of disappointment (decreasing order) has to be 1. Rohit 2. Dhawan 3. Yuvraj 4. Raina. Both the openers have gone too hard in power play while the other 2 batsmen have not adapted to modified roles in match situations. It is time for batsmen to improve short selection, adapt to match situations &amp; provide a solid batting foundation. Considering the strengths of WI, IND don't need to make more than 1 change for injured Yuvraj, If IND do make more than 1 change it could well backfire &amp; critics may well have change the query to why new players weren't tried earlier. It is significant that IND recently lost ODI series in AUS 1-4 after drastic changes &amp; lost in SF of CWC 2015 with just 1 50+innings each from Rahane &amp; Kohli .

If Dhoni were a captain of soccer team, he probably would not make any substitution. Not changing 11, can't change 11, too late to change, etc are unscientific theories. Innovative thinkers such as NZ has said before its SF that it would go for horses for courses. 
</p>
<p>
Raina and Yuvi seem to be struggling. Panday will score as many runs (if not more) as these combined. Bhajji or Negi can come in. I know people will say Mumbai is a flat pitch so this Yuvi and Raina will come good but what about Kol. And these two already got opportunities where they almost knocked Ind out. It is never too late to make the right changes. No team has ever lost by bringing in an inform player.

Dhawan, Rohit and Raina are three who are enjoying the fruits of Kohli and Dhoni. It is proved once on the first match of this T20 World cup, that India cannot cross 100 runs if Kohli and Dhoni can not contribute much. It is time for the openers to open their eyes in the Semifinal at least. Remember that this selection committee gives preference for form and consistency (Nehra).

Raina had taken his place for granted as he has put on weight and that will affect his movements and it shows. Yuvi must play if he is fit. Rohit and Dhawan do not guarantee a good opening burst as both of them had misfired and literally saved by Kohli's consistency. Dhoni must bring in some change to be on toes to fight in the SF clash with WI. Giving the players a guarantee on their previous performances and reputation is not logic at all in this sport, especially when people like Manish, Rahane are waiting in the dug out.

Either Yuvraj or Raina need to sitout and give place to Rahane. He is a cool customer when low scores like 120, 140 requires just singles and odd boundary. Dhoni can play Jadeja/Pandey up in the order above Rahane if hard hitting required.

This is more about being fair to all players. Players like dhawan and raina seem to be receiving unlimited chances over the last few years and their scores have not justified their assured place in the team, no matter how many times they fail. Rahane who has been outstanding in the last few years, especially on fast pitches and against quality pace attacks, has been a passenger without getting a fair number of chances. Also dhoni now talks about players making certain spots their own by peforming solidly but in the Bangladesh series, rahane who had performed well in the middle order, was shuffled in the batting order just to accommodate rohit sharma. And we have seen that the constant failures of dhawan, raina etc have been covered only by Kohli's brilliance otherwise India would have been out in the first round itself, so it is high time dhoni selects the team keeping the teams best interests in mind.

Raina is seating duck whenever pitch offers a bit to bowler in either spin or seam. It is not a speculation. His record shows that. His dismal test record confirms that. Give him a flat pitch and he transforms in to a world beater. Add Dhwan another one who struggles on the difficult conditions and you have scratchy start on hand that puts all the pressure on Kohli. Yuvraj is different cattle of fish. It is known that he is in twilight years but give him a big occasion and he will find a way to contribute. He will hang in there and provide a helping hand to his team. Asia cup and this world cup against Pakistan he was at the other end when Kohli was winning the world over. Not Raina not Dhwan not Rohit. India had such a difficult world cup due to failure of Rohit, Raina and Dhwan. And there non contribution is not surprising given that India has been playing on difficult decks. MSD needs to take a call on million $ question, weather his team can overcome a Kohli failure in knock outs.

It is Dhawan, Rohit and Raina, not Yuvraj. Yuvraj was holding the fort at the other end during the last match (and earlier matches too) allowing his partner to score freely. Unfortunately, he was injured during the last match. Yes, his reflexes have slowed down, but he isn't throwing away his wicket like Dhawan, Rohit and Raina. Rahane could still come in at 4 instead of Raina and score some 25 or 20 balls instead of succumbing to short balls every time.

I feel picking pandey in place of Yuvi to be strange. Yuvi proved to be more than a handy bowler at many instances. In case a bowler is having a bad day (Ashwin against Aus). Yuvi will be more hands on than anyone else. I think he must be backed up by Someone like Gurkreet Mann, who can bowl and Fire as a finisher. I agree he is not upto mark in Australia, But Indian grounds must be comfortable to him in shorter format.

Yuvi will definatly fire. Raina is good fielder and good supporting bowler. These two can not be replaced in this WC. After that we can replace any one or two. If you want to replace replace Dhawan with Ajinkya OR Manish. These two will definitely will fire Semi final or final. Beter to look on Ajinkya instead or Dhawan. Rahane is came good in IPL as opener than Dhawan.

why there is no mention of the hyped but miserably failing Rohit Sharma, he has come a cropper so far in this T-20 World cup, still the team management day dream for a miracle to happen in this regard. Let them take a leaf out of New Zelanders' book,though they have great seamers in Tim Southee  and Trent Bolt , they have fielded a fine bunch of eleven cricketers who have not let down there team ;horses for courses,here in Indian team certain horses regularly fail yet they are pampered

Rahane should come in and open the innings with Dhawan. Kohli at 3 and Rohit at 4 (where he normally bats for MI in IPL). Its time for Raina to go and learn to play short pitch balls.

Include Rahane instead of either Dhawan or Raina. Rest of the team is just okay unless Yuvi is replaced due to injury. Pandey is an idol replacement but Yuvi's bowling will be missed.

We have to leave aside sentiments and play like a professional team.  If India persist with those non performing players it will start a worst precedence where by all captains coming after Dhoni will give chance to their preferred eleven irrespective of merit.  Atleast to avoid this,  I hope good sense prevail and players are selected based on current form for the knockout games

It should be a major concern that India, with its vast pool of top-level cricketers, has to go into a home T20 World Cup carrying three players (Yuvraj, Nehra and Harbhajan Singh) - all of whom are very clearly past their Sell-By Date at this level.
</p>
<p>
And Dhoni surely will be gone soon, as well. His body seems to be giving up on him.
</p>
<p>
Experience undoubtedly has a significant value, but - with the amount of T20 (IPL, etc) that the Indians play - where are the younger guys who should be filling those slots?

They can't rely just on Kohli to keep on carrying them.

i have been a big fan of pandey from his underage cricket and have followed him from then but going in with him as replacement for yuvi isnt a wise thing to do as he as never played the role of finisher in t20 so expecting him to do that and do it successfully in semifinal of WC would be asking for too much so its a lot better to have rahane at 4 and push raina to 5....if yuvi is fit then raina has to be dropped and rahane needs to take his place

Pandey should have been in the team from the beginning. A brilliant player with strong nerve, this is what we need now! About time Raina and Yuvi stay out; not sure of Rahane. He's never been impressive. Negi could be given a chance rather than him. Dhawan and Rohit are class players, a few innings without big scores shouldn't mean they need to sit out. The author has analysed it very well. Really hopeful either Yuvi or Raina would be replaced with Pandey!

If Yuvi is injured, Pandey, though not in the original squad, can come in, even in the last minute, with ICC's permission. Logistics alone used to create delays in such emergency substitutions. But, fortunately, that isn't the case of Manish Pandey.

A batsman who didn't have match practice (say Pandey, or Rahane for that matter) may play only at about 75%. But isn't 75% better than 65%?  And, far better than 35%, excluding Dhoni's accompaniment to the virtuoso soloist Kohli?

Come On!
Rahane has not performed in any of the matches in Asia Cup , India-SL series or even the WT20 practice matches.
I was there at Wankhede during IND-SA warm ups and honestly Rahane struggled big time. In case Yuvi doesn't make it to the squad then Pandey/Negi can be the only options.
Rahane needs to prove his worth as a top 3 batsman at the moment. He has played flamboyant innings but right now he is struggling. Dhoni is living in the present and Rahane at middle order is just not right!
I even feel if Pandey comes in, he really needs to run well b/w the wickets. He is at times has brain fades at the crease. Saw him doing that that exactly at the DY Patil Stadium few days back.
I won't prefer Negi because WI batsman will probably target him very badly and batting depth suffers if Negi is replaced by Yuvi.
Wankhede is a batting paradise and the team who bats out the other out of the game will go to the Eden Gardens.

You can't replace Raina with Rahane......Rahane is only good at opening the innings....so let him swap Dhawan.But that's an unlikely change in the semis.We have to stick to the same 11. Dhawan is due for a good innings.He will defenitly play well to retain his spot in the team.Same is the case with Rohit.Also the match is at wankhede,where Rohit is at his best in IPL.

Indian selectors have made the error of not including Manish Pandey in the original squad, he is a quality act as we saw against Australia in Australia. He is a match winner like Kohli, makes no sense not having him in the side and non performer like Raina getting so many chances.

People criticising Rainafor a Rahane are missing a point here. As the writer himself has correctly pointed out it is very rare Raina wastes any deliveries. In his good touch he can score upto 170+SR. On the other hand I have seen many innings of Rahane when he has scored at 110 or 115 SR even when he is in good touch. There is a reason why people like raina are difficult to remove from a t20 side.

whenever Yuvraj has batted, its been of help for the team. he may have scored just at sub-100 strike rate. But the important thing is that he had given Kohli the security to think about timing the chase well or timing the innings well knowing fully that Yuvraj will stay around for a few overs. It has really helped Kohli to play his natural game, settle in and go for the kill once he is settled... on the bowling front, Yuvraj won India the game with a spell of 3 overs for 19 plus a wicket. he more than filled Ashwin's quota of overs, who looked terrible for his 2 overs. Yuvraj also multiplied the drying of runs

But the important thing is that he had given Kohli the security to think about timing the chase well or timing the innings well knowing fully that Yuvraj will stay around for a few overs. It has really helped Kohli to play his natural game, settle in and go for the kill once he is settled... on the bowling front, Yuvraj won India the game with a spell of 3 overs for 19 plus a wicket. he more than filled Ashwin's quota of overs, who looked terrible for his 2 overs. Yuvraj also multiplied the drying of runs

1. I like Raina but he's been a frustrating international cricketer. I think his time is up after this world cup.
2. I don't know what to say about Rohit. I hope he will come good at the business end of the tournament.
3. Dhawan is over-rated. His test and T20 record are sub-par. I think he's done well in ODIs despite being inconsistent. Rahane should replace him at the top in the T20s.
4. Yuvraj should never have been part of this team. He single-handedly lost the previous world cup final. He was not part of the plans in the next one and a half years and suddenly in the last six months, he's in the team. He hasn't looked like playing a substantial innings. I can understand Dhoni having him because of his bowling but he's hardly bowled in this tournament. Manish Pandey should have been in the team, especially after playing that match winning innings in Australia.
5. Harbajan should not have been in the team. I mean what are his chances of playing in place of Ashwin?

Wrong time for Yuvi to exit,esp when he is being his fluent best at hitting those free flow sixers and supporting Kohli in the middle with experience.Big big loss for India that.

why have a squad of 15 exactly and MSD has to answer it. Semis so what, who ever comes Kohli and MSD are not going to change their game. apart from ashwin bumraj nehra jadeja,who ever plays doesnt matter .The replacements can actually take place of Rohit,who is playing like a spectator. Dhawan is fielding well taking catches well at pressure situation.Bring in two spinners Bhajji &amp; Negi .Ind can open with Kohli and dhawan, with Raina coming one down followed by MSD and Pandya.If these cant hit out no point in asking tailenders to do the job.

Yuvraj Singh almost cost India the game by not retiring hurt. His inability to run help increase the scoring rate which otherwise would have been at manageable level...he should take the opportunity and announce his retirement.

Lot of people are forgetting that Yuvraj has had only 1 bad game.
</p>
<p>
He bowled very well when he was asked to when our mainstream spinners were clobbered. And he has batted as the situation required in the rest of the games. India needed partnerships when Yuvi had walked in. Not fast runs. He has provided exactly what team needed at that stage without worrying about personal gains. A lesser character would have tried to slog and show he is in good touch to keep his place in team. But this guy did what was needed in previous games as well.
I 100% agree that he is not the same flamboyant Yuvraj of the past. That Yuvi is hiding in there somewhere at the moment. But he has given balance to the side and did everything that has been asked of him. 
Ideally he should be coming ahead of Raina but that has not happened. There is very little he can do about that situation. 
I can see Pandey coming in for Yuvi if he is not fit, but if he is fit, he has to play. It gives us additional bowling option.

Let's see what these ppl do in the semis now....Dhawan, Raina &amp; Rohit are all IPL material. Indian selectors will realize soon after Dhoni departs. It  will be hard for India to fill his shoes especially when you have these 3 greats in the team. Also there was no need of Harbhjan visiting Australia when some young blood could have easily gained the experiance. Also there is no need of Yuvraj, batting lineup. Thank you very much and enjoy the game. India is lucky they won the game against Aussies &amp; 100% Yuvraj was to be blamed if results were  He wasted 3-5 balls, doubles, time &amp; concentration of Virat..Yuvraj should have walked out retied hurt.

It amazes me that no oneis questioning extremely poor batting performance of Indian's EXCEPT the Great (yes, now we can call him that) Kohli. What is shameful is favouritism shown in selecting Raina. He has been given so many chances just because he is Dhoni's best buddy!. Ajinkya Rahane is the best Indian batsman only after Kohli. Yet, he is conveniently dropped to find a place for Raina. Yuvraj is a past star. You don't play a world cupt with a half fit past star. In his place Manish Pandey should have been in. Similarly Akshar Patel (in place of another past star Nehra) should play in the team. One can understand chances given to Dhawan and Rohit. Both have immense talent, but it is high time they show it in performance. India is a Nation of 1.25 billion. Our talent pool is rich. But favouritism is ruining the performance. Rather we take refuge is shinning stars like Kholi. Again, comparing Kohli with Sachin is not on yet. One day he may be greater than Sachin, but long way to go.

how virat sank to his knees at the end shows how much pressure &amp; burden the guy is under with all the NPA's around him. feel for the guy. 
the one bad thing about the win is that once again all of the failures will be papered over. it's been this way for years now. i dont know why the selectors are so scared to make changes. its like an investor put money in shares who doesnt exit even as he sees the stocks crashing. same thing was done with the test side as a a result of which we had that embarassing loss to eng at home. irrespective of how things go in next 2 matches sincerely hope steps are taken. CT &amp; even WC is not too far. good teams start planning years in advance. coming to SF, if we win the toss we should bat 2nd even though its more pressure. 1st is that dew has been an issue; 2nd is its a chasing ground; 3rd &amp; most imp is since everything is dependent on virat may as well give him his strong suit.

If Yuvi is unavailable due to injury, then I would actually have Rahane open with Dhawan and have Rohit play at No 4. Play Raina at 5. And keep rest of the squad unchanged. Raina is not a No 4 batsman. He is better off at no 5.

And why is Rohit Sharma an automatic selection? Dhawan scores over Rohit Sharma on temperamental stuff. He has delivered in critical situations before. Rohit except scoring big in nondescript games has never delivered in crunch. There are severe temperamental issues exhibit A is also how he approaches test cricket .His mental preparation for championship games show lack of composing an innings either tuk-tuk or slam bang. With Dhawan there was a silver lining in last game and the pressure of Rohit not doing anything got Dhawan to try an extravagant hook. 
I would really like Rohit to be on the bench and get Rahane in his place instead for final two games.

I saw a couple of comments on Rohit, but just before this WT20, he was firing all cylinders and was the most consistent batsman. This year he is one of the tope 3 rungetters in both ODIs and T20s and suddenly one series goes bad and couple of people start saying he does not perform..Shame people

Yuvi is now just a mere reflection of his old self. He looks so vulnerable against pace and bounce. In 2014 T20 finals, in Asia cup and now the present WT20 we can clearly notice his weaknesses. He was a liability in the last match too. But Kohli's brilliance his the weaknesses of the other batsmen. All that Kohli needed in his current form was a kid with a stick who can give the strike back to him and keep pace with him, which MSD did. Yuvi with his injury and poor running almost made a mess of that match. Rest of the batsmen too are not in any form worth mentioning. Let us hope at least a couple of others steps up in the semi's Cheers!

The author is not being fair to Yuvraj. Yuvraj may not be at his fluent best , but he had to rebuild the innings with Kohli on with India losing the top 3 with little on the board.These were knockout matches high-pressure situations while chasing but let's not be uncharitable , but for those partnerships, India would have lost against Pakistan . It was unfortunate he got injured else he might have added a few more run to the total. He has also contributed with the ball as well. The problem for India is the lower order , they hardly infuse any confidence , once we lose top 6 there is no stokes/butler /mmali .

Yuvi, Raina, Rohit and Dhawan has been feeding on the brilliance of Kohli in the recent past. Kohli may be the best in world cricket today, but he too will perish if he has to continue shouldering such pressure for long. It will be good if Yuvi's injury keeps him out of the future matches. This will allow Pandey to take his place. It would be good if Rahane or even Negi comes in place of Raina. As of now don't think we have any better options for openers, as we have already seen that Rahane is also Vulnerable against pace and swing initially, but he sure may do better than Dhawan or Rohit if given a longer rope. Let us hope that other batsmen also fire in the semi's as we need all guns blazing if Gayle has a good day. Cheers!

I certainly don't blame Yuvi in fact, he helped india in both matches. Through out the tournament he came to bat under tremendous pressure because in all matches so far the 3 wickets fell in no time, courtesy Nohit, Dhawan, and Raina. So Yuvi and Kholi had to steady the innings for 5-6 overs rather than attacking the opponents. I just can't understand why Dhoni is still keeping Nohit, Dhawan, and Raina when Rahane, Manish and others are sitting. India can't afford to play with 8 players  in the Semi finals. In this case Dhoni is thick head.

Why not replace Rohit Sharma with Rahane. Both are good fielders and can't bowl well enough. Both right handers. 1 plays consistently and the other scores 200s every 20 games. 1 got 100s of chances and the other is blamed without enough games. Kohli and Dhoni should be beware of Rohit, Dhawan and Raina's inconsistency. Its funny that these are the 2 captains who supported them vigorously and these are 2 players on which all pressure falls and others free riding on Kohli and Dhoni. These 2 have unbelievable cricketing brains but have no foresight on where to invest. Thats what makes Ganguly a better captain. This is the reason we have to rely back on Yuvi and Bhajji because thats the best choice we had. Kudos to the selectors for forcing Pandya and Bumrah into the team. Give atleast 10% of chance Rohit/Raina received to Rahane and youngsters before its too late for next world cup.

How many years will it take for Raina to settle in an Indian Team? Everybody talks about his fielding ability. Rahane/Pandey are better fielders. Also Raina cannot field along the ropes. He dont have strong arm or accurate throw.

Apart from being aggressive, I still dont know what Hardik role in the side.

Two days to go for the semifinals. No word on Yuvraj yet. Looks like he is fine and he will play. Manish and Rahane have to wait unfortunately even with an injury in the air floating around. It is what it is. Why are Yuvraj and Raina not announcing their retirement plans like Shane Watson did. They will earn more respect from fans if they do that right now. Dhawan (gets a decent run of failures before he comes up with one knock which helps him stay longer), Rohit, Yuvraj and Raina are putting this team under tremendous pressure every single game. Come on guys, you guys are done, we have a class batsman waiting for opportunities. move aside. move on.

The dismal run of the openers and the bowler friendly pitches have actually helped Yuvi. He is clearly no longer the enforcer of the old times. The fact that the openers have fallen cheaply has meant that he has had to come in, and steady the ship with Kohli, and I daresay he has done a great job. Agreed that in Mohali, it almost cost us the match. But in the Asia cup, or even against Pakistan in the world cup, he has ended up playing crucial little supporting roles. In any case if he is ruled out, with Manish Pandey coming in, it might all be a blessing in disguise.

After having read all the comments from readers of this article, I would suggest people to show some faith in the team chosen.

<p>
If we all were to suggest what is to be done, then why is there a team management and a captain. India deserved to be in the Semi-Final and they have made it there. What happens next will happen but we can hold our heads high with pride. MSD is a very good and shrewd captain, it is not easy to be the captain of an International team for 9 years. Virat Kohli has been fantastic, no words left to describe his prowess and ability. Rohit, Dhawan, Raina have misfired but it is right to back them as they are proven performers. Yuvraj is a match-winner any day. Rahane and Manish are great talents too but forcibly fitting them into a settled line-up can mess the momentum India have at the moment.
</p>
<p>
If Yuvraj is injured, Rahane should play and bat at no. 4 as it is his home ground. Otherwise the same XI should play the match. I am sure these blokes will fire soon for Ind

Anyway there are two issues to address before making changes, other than the fitness issue of Yuvraj; (i) how good are the WI as far as strategy is concerned, do they prey on the weaknesses of the batsmen?  If not, then keep Dhawan and Raina, (ii) can the team deal with a newcomer like Pandey or Rahane?  There seems to be some good vibes in the team, despite abject failures from the top order.

Yuvraj injury is blow for india.His batting is just ok and bowling ability is crucial for india.His short partnership with kohli shouldn't be discounted.Raina,dhawan and rohit has been putting hell lot of pressure repeatedly on dhoni and kohli in the last 4 matches.Raina seems very vulnerable against short ball.Rahane and pandey are good option for replacing raina and dhawan.But dhoni will not tinker with changes in last minute. Hope rest of the batsman come good against Windies.

There is no way to explain Raina's inclusion in any form of the game on technical merit or performance or potential for many years now from my perspective. It taints Dhoni's legacy somewhat, dragging along a non performer for so long. At least with Yuvraj there is a fear factor from earlier days. Rohit will win a game for you single handedly every now and then and Dhawan has had a few lovely innings against quality bowling in the ODI World Cup to point to. With Raina, except for a 50 in 2011 World Cup quarter final, his performance and technique is embarrassing.

Yuvi came in twice on hat trick ball. The openers (Rohit and Dhawan) have played more dot balls and then given wickets. Raina is a 2 over 15-20 batsmen. If not for Yuvi then India wouldnt have been 94/3 at 14 overs. 6 overs 66 to win against aussies.
You know how well Jadega and Pandya bats. Yuvi is the guy who can hit sixes. Rohit never has performed on important occasions throught his career apart from IPL. Its been like that since 7-8 years now.
I would take playing 11 as
Dhawan(he performs on major occasion), Rahane (L&amp;R bat combination), Vira, Manish Pandey/Raina (someone he does get 12 ball 20 runs good for t20), Yuvi / Manish Pandey, Dhoni, Pandya, Jadeja, Bumra, Nehra.

This analysis is about 1,2,4,5 playing and making less than 3. But i don't see anything about Rohit . All i could read is Dhawan is a big match player. Raina either hits out or gets out. Yuvi is subdued version of his pre-cancer days .  Author has raised serious questions of India's top orders with numbers . Not sure why Nohit was not brought into this discussion .  Anyways India is still desperately waiting on Yuvi's fitness. Dhoni rarely changes his team and all throughout OZ , Asia cup, WC  series we have seen a settled combination. If Yuvi is match fit he will go for it . Fitness is main driving force rather than form since India relies on these same playing XI to win us WC. Don't see much in talking about weakness of any of these top order players when in middle of WC. Dhoni as always kept his cards close to his chest . If Yuvi misses out i am more worried about Jadeja's overs with Yuvi (SLA) based on conditions and right handed batsmen. 8 overs instead of 4 overs is a big gap!!!

Spot on, article! Kholi apart, What are the rest of batsmen doing? Rohit again going into shell forgetting team and taking time to settle down at the cost of run rate while chasing. Selfish n shame. Dhawan must use his head n not just shoulders. Raina who..when..what..finally why is he still in team. His selection was based on future hypothesis that ipl star will fire in indian pitches. Raina n Negi sound reckless selections. Yuvraj, i think, even his most ardent fans are out of voice. He must stop looking serious n start scoring runs. Dhoni as shrewd as he is, just hiding low in the order. When was his last big score and looked in full flow. His keeping is genius but batting is well short. Also this right left obsession must go, n best batsmen must be selected. For ex, Manish Pandey well deserved Raina's place. Rahane deserves Dhawan's place.

After playing 10 years or so and still trying yo solve technicalities of batting, somehow it doesn't make sense to continue with Raina.  I guess he has two games left in his career if and if India reaches finals.  Move on from Raina and bring in somebody else with striking power preferably a youngster

Straight from my mouth @YOGIFROMNY. Dhoni is very stubborn and it always looks like he wants to prove people that his persistence always pays off. This is probably the only ground with good pace and carry through to the keeper and I can say Rahane will have a gala time out there. He likes it when the ball comes on to the bat quicker. It suits his game. Chuck Dhawan for once. Pandey in for Yuvi and I hate to say it but Yuvi can't be a liability at a crucial phase. He knows it better than us having already been in this position once before. These changes, if Dhoni makes, will make sure All is Well! And yes make use of the 15 in the Squad dammit!

It was shocking to select Yuvraj and Harbhajan in the 15 man squad and to let Yuvraj play despite his lost bat speed while he barely bowled is puzzling. On the flip side to leave Manish Pandey out of the squad in spite of him being one the most successful batsmen in IPL is sad. We are willing to risk the trophy for a couple of recommended players. Yuvraj is going to be liability and in the semis and final and his selection will come back and bite us in the back. Unfortunately us fans no clout to make it fair to beat a biased system.  On the other Raina is a major disappointment..he cant play short ball and couple of bouncers will fluster him and have him lose his wicket.

If West Indies bowlers do well they will win, India has lot of free loaders who are not carrying their weight. Kohli, Nehra, Ashwin, and Bumrah have carried the team and to a lesser extent Dhoni and jadeja, rest of them have not performed.

We won in 2011 because a misfiring Yusuf Pathan was replaced by Raina from quarter finals and Raina did well to save the Pak game.And Sreesanth replaced injured Nehra in final.In 2007,injured Sehwag was replaced by Yusuf Pathan in final.In all other World Cups,Dhoni kept playing the same and we couldn't win.Bottomline,we need to replace some players here.Any two of Manish,Rahane and Bhajji can replace Yuvi and Bhajji.

Continuing from my first post - this is a brilliant ploy by Dhoni. In the group stages, his excuse for playing Dhawan and other non-performers was "you need to give them a long rope, can't just drop them after a couple of bad performances". Now his excuse will be "can't experiment in the knockout stages!" Either way, his stubborn refusal to accept Rahane is way better than Dhoni's assessment of him is likely to cost India the WC. Dhoni's refusal to drop Yuvi cost us the 2014 WC final, so it won't be a first.

Not including Rahane in place of Dhawan defies all logic! Dhoni is too stubborn to admit he was wrong and would rather mess with India's chances of winning than replace Dhawan. If you don't believe me, look at his persistence with Yuvraj in the 2014 WC, which did cost India the final. Bring in Pandey for Yuvi and Rahane for Dhawan: what are the selectors for if Dhoni is the one who calls the shots on team selection? Why have a team of 15 at all if you are only going to use 11 players regardless of their performance? From a disgusted Indian fan in NY.

I'd rather see Ajikya Rahane replace the opener with most dot balls in the WCT20 thus far. My reasoning is that he can rotate the strike and hold one end while the other opener attacks more freely. Only if Yuvi is injured, play Pandey in his place. Remember, Yuvi has delivered with the ball too.

rahane and panday in for dhawan and raina. yuvraj has done much better than these two liabilities with all bowling batting and fielding also. remember, one should not compare yuvraj with dhawan and raina. both got every chance in flat tracks since Australia to get their form in. but yuvraj not only never got such kinds of chance, but also rescued the team most of the time with kohli in some real crunch situations. like all three matches against Pakistan and some more matches. his bowling is additional asset to have. in vitual quarter final against Australia also, wothy yuvraj served with three crucial overs to compensate the costly ashwin, jadeja and pandya overs. injury is something else, otherwise he is needed with all aspects.

In a way its great to see Pandey and Rahane at least in the reckoning. Dhawan should long have been replaced by Rahane after 3 consecutive failures and Raina shouldn't have been in squad at all after Asia cup disaster. Pandey should have been there instead. Rohit Rahane Kohli Pandey Yuvi Dhoni Jadeja Bhajji Ashwin Bumrah Nehra would have been the ideal squad. Pandey and Rahane could not have done worse than woeful Dhawan and Raina any day. Dhoni's decisions could have cost us big time in all matches but thanks to Kohli's brilliance we were saved the blushes.

But it is not just due to luck that India has reached SF !
And certainly Kohli got Team India into semis Never the less it is fair to say that despite below par batting Team India is in semis due to some good bowling by likes of Nehraji , Bumrah, Ashwin, Jadeja. The article is ok as far the views about batting and guys like Rahane, Manish did deserve a match before the semis

@EXPERIENCEISOVERRATED, that statement defies logic in the same way Dhoni's selections do. Rohit, Dhawan and Raina occupy the top 4 along with Kohli and with their wretched returns (right from the start of Asia Cup) have put pressure on everyone else in the order. If you want Raina's fielding (which is not as good as you think) bring him in as a sub for anyone. Yuvi has been instrumental in building partnerships with Kohli when all seemed lost is some very crucial matches. But like your screen name suggests, you don't get the value of experience. Btw so much is made of Yuvi's strike rate but Dhoni has been no hitter either and the less said about the batting 'ability' of Jadeja the better. How on earth a mediocre player like Negi made it over Mishra is something I will never get.

Yuvi played well against Pak and Aus. His experience in both batting and bowling is very much needed to team. He is building team winning partnerships at the crucial times. He will be fit and he will play semis for sure. Its better to replace Raina or Dhawan, who failed in this tournament so far.

Dhoni will pick some Tom, Dick or Harry off the street than pick Rahane for a middle order spot - He is just too STUBBORN to admit that he was wrong all along - even if it costs India the WC. He can pickup Rohit ahead of Rahane for his bowling, Jadeja ahead of Mishra for his batting - and the list goes on. Rahane will have to wait until Dhoni steps down and at the same time maintain cordial relations with Kohli to find himself as a regular in IND team.

It is easy to suggest that Raina should go and YuvRaj should go. People often forget that the reason why they were in the first place. It was not any body's charity that they established themselves in the positions they are. They performed and performed under pressure. Rahane is a good batsman but not certainly in the class of Raina or Yuvraj. Raina could start hitting from ball one which is a rare commodity. Sure, failures happen, but then who does not? Most talented and 360 degree players like Glen Maxwell and Steven Smith do fail. That's the nature of the game.Arriving in 14-15th over and start scoring right a way, at a rate of 12 an over, only few can do that. Raina and YuvRaj both left handed, could hit big sixes which is invaluable in T20 game. They do not need to carry on for ever, it is just for 3 to 4 overs. I honestly believe that they are still India's available best for the no.5 and 6. Failures..hm.. they happen to every one..

Everything said and done, please no Rahane. He's no fit for T20. Let's have Manish Pandey or someone. Replacing one snail (Yuvi) with another (Rahane) is not a good idea.

Perfect analysis. Manish Pandey instead of Yuvraj gives a lot of confidence and assurance for fans, both on fielding and also running between the wickets. Also he can hit sixes.fours better than current Yuvraj

Yuvraj needs to go. Raina still has value because he is a brilliant fielder, while Yuvraj isn't. Definitely not anymore, at least. Bring in Rahane for Yuvraj as the batting won't suffer, but at least there will be more added on the field.

@take-it-easy, I wish you would have asked your hero Rohit the same question after getting blown on the leg on the first ball and then getting officially out on the second one. The average bowler amazed the below par cement pitch and 60 meter boundary batsman. Isn't it? Was Rohit the highest scorer in any world tournament or even in IPL? The answer is BIG NO too :)

Best batsman in world (kholi) has said amir is a world class bowler.. Rohit just looks upset.. :-) stats is not even everything.. Specially when taking about a bowler in t20.. Off course,  being Wasim akram is next level, which is legend.. Bopara got 6 wickets in 4 overs in psl so it means bopara is the best t20 bowler yet?

Right after his arguments about amir that no one should talk about amir, he needs to do much more etc, he started talking about Bumrah. wont same logic applies for him? needs to do more and consistent? and arent other 4 bowlers doing well for india? I would take Kohli's and Dhonis words than Rohits. because Msd is greatest captain and Kohli is one of the great batsmen. Amir isnt only praised by Kohli, Dhoni or Pakistani players, he has been praised by many all over the world. is Rohit trying to say that he is better than others to talk?

@take-it-easy, I wish you would have asked your hero Rohit the same question after getting blown on the leg on the first ball and then getting officially out on the second one. The average bowler amazed the below par cement pitch and 60 meter boundary batsman. Isn't it? Was Rohit the highest scorer in any world tournament or even in IPL? The answer is BIG NO too :)

Simple question.. Amir played bpl and psl, was he the top bowler in those tournaments, the answer is a big NO, not even close. This tells u everything. He is just an average bowler who can be good against team like Oman.

Best batsman in world (kholi) has said amir is a world class bowler.. Rohit just looks upset.. :-) stats is not even everything.. Specially when taking about a bowler in t20.. Off course,  being Wasim akram is next level, which is legend.. Bopara got 6 wickets in 4 overs in psl so it means bopara is the best t20 bowler yet?

Right after his arguments about amir that no one should talk about amir, he needs to do much more etc, he started talking about Bumrah. wont same logic applies for him? needs to do more and consistent? and arent other 4 bowlers doing well for india? I would take Kohli's and Dhonis words than Rohits. because Msd is greatest captain and Kohli is one of the great batsmen. Amir isnt only praised by Kohli, Dhoni or Pakistani players, he has been praised by many all over the world. is Rohit trying to say that he is better than others to talk?

I cant believe people are comparing Amir to Bumrah, no doubt Bumrah is a great bowler but the impact and effectiveness of Amir is too great. Even for a batting lineup of India found it difficult to chase a mere 84 runs.. 
Lets call a spade a spade guys... its like shahid afridi saying that Kohli is a normal player and the real find is Sarfaraz.. respect the modern day greats even though i always root against Kohli but his batting is too good to deny the fact that he is an all time great. Same is the case with Amir, dont hate just because he belongs to Pakistan. Love the game, Respect the players!!

Well, Sharma is right! Finding a world class bowler in Pakistan is very 'normal' and finding a real bowler in India is definitely 'rare'. Sharma is right!

Well, I understand the anti-Rohit comments here but actually he is not totally off the mark. Truth is, it is very early days for Amir and batsman have seen little of him thus far. Let's see how he evolves. Media always likes to create a big hype around something that could be. Bumrah also has shown potential. While Bumrah's addition has lifted Team India's spirits the inclusion of Amir seems to have deflated his Pak team-mates. Lot of people tended to criticize the great SRT for not winning matches for India when India's bowlers at most times were virtually incapable of bowling out opposition twice! Now Amir is a bowler and how many matches did Pak win???

Guys, please know the reason behind the hype. Aamer is a proven bowler, of the current Pakistan team he has played abroad more than any player with the exception of Misbah and Younus Khan. Hence the world is looking forward to his return, also both Aamer and Wahab in my personal opinion are test bowlers, Aamer has a good record in tests whereas Bumra has only played a few T20's, Rohit is right in saying Aamer needs to show consistency but the same applies for Bumra and himself of course. My making over the top statements like this he is just making himself look silly and upset at the fact that his team had trouble playing Aamer.

Aamir is a normal bowler and good for only favourable condition??? Pardon me guys the same implies on Rohit as I have never seen him batting well on swinging pitches. He is also scored on flat tracks unlike Virat Kohli. I have no doubt that Rohit will score against good bowlers even Aamir on flat tracks in his home ground as he use to do for years and if Aamir is not good enough then Rohit is even worse...

Wasim Akram is my favourite bowler followed by Mcgrath &amp; Ambrose...I like to include all these three bowlers in my playing eleven...Akram is the only bowler who knew to bowl six different balls in one over...Pak is fortunate to have such greatest bowler (just like SRT for India)...but I doubt that Aamir belongs to this league (although it is very early to say)...Rohit is right &amp; i want to see how he faces Aamir in this T20 WC...Rohit is the only player now who pulls the ball in both front foot &amp; back foot positions (Smith is the good puller of the ball in back foot position like Ponting &amp; SRT)...can he utilise this technique against Aamir &amp; co...

Well what he said is right.  Aamir bowled a great first couple of overs in that game. But he couldn't repeat it in any other games.  1 good spell does not define a bowler. Irfan Pathan once took a hatrick in the first over of a test match with similar bowling, a little lesser pace, and look where he is now!!  No doubt Aamir is a rare talent,  and hope he conquers the world. But miles to go before he can be compared to wasim!!  Bumrah too looks good, but what makes him look better is he was consistent in all the games. But again he has to prove his worth in the long run, I.e. once teams work out his bowling nd action

Why people can't digest the success of others? He is right Wahab,Irfan,junaid all are talented but no one can make it swing like aamir, neither they are as consistent and economical as Aamir. Wahab relies on Pace only, for Irfan its bounce, junaid makes it swing only. While Amir has all of these qualities. If Bumrah is rare then Amir is the rarest. and those who think he can't be a waseem, they should watch waseem's bowling when he was 22. There is not much difference, if there is any difference that is in favour of Amir not waseem.

thats true, we should speak of pearls of our necklace...but no doubt Amir is a wonderful bowler...have some talent similar to wasim akram ....but has to prove a lot to get near to that legend of immense calibre...wasim was a person with six different deliveries that can trouble any batsman...

Welll! Rohit has all the right to claim so because he didn't last enough balls to admire and understand the quality of Amir's bowling. 
And in the land of B. Kumar, A. Nehra etc etc, Bhumra is surely a world class bowler, best wishes for his career :P

Well he's half right and half wrong. Surely Amir is not the best bowler in the world today as all Pakhistanis claim. And surely Bumrah is not half as good as Amir. He has a future quite similar to Nehra or B Kumar.

Rohit is an ordinary test batsman and on a good bowling pitch..he might be very dangerous on flat pitches though. He faced only 2 deliveries from Amir and was out on both..when did the last time any Indian bowler has bowled such fiery spell..swinging at 145+ kmph. I believe Amir lost around 200 wickets in last 5 years and he is as good as he was then. I would like Amir to fail in every India match but succeed in other matches as we need such world class bowlers in modern batsman-era game where only handful of such bowlers are left now.

Amir's bowling against India was simply outstanding and Rohit is probably downplaying Amir as he has to face him again shortly(psychological ploy) and nothing wrong with it. 
</p>
<p>
However, I agree it still too early to compare him with the legendary "Sultan of Swing" Wasim. Wasim had the ability to make the ball talk in any condition along with a toe crushing, swinging yorkers !! I hope Amir continues his journey to greatness, makes India vs Pakistan matches very exciting.

well looks like rohit is totally feeling pressure of facing aamir again so he is trying to get the pressure shifted by stating aamir as normal bowler its not a game or over that makes a bowler great but his attitude i saw aamir in asia cup he learnt his mistake of bowling noball and he is bowling with great commitment i agree with virat kohli that aamir is great bowling option and he will one day become one of the great fast bowler and regarding rohit comment aamir need not think about it and make his swing talk

Rohit did not say that Amir is an ordinary bowler.  He is only saying that Amir is hyped too much.  There are other good bowlers in Pakistan and other teams.  He was also saying that one or two overs of a bowler will not make him great.  Amir needs to continue doing as good as he is doing now consistently well.  In New Zealand, Amir was not just above ordinary.

Rohit Sharma almost got out first ball he faced from Amir, then second ball was definitely out. 2 balls, beaten twice, 0 runs, out. Since Amir is "just an ordinary bowler" I wonder how bad that makes Rohit Sharma.

One thing's for sure, if I were Rohit, I wouldn't be dissing a bowler who just toyed with me in our last encounter.

Agree with Rohit. Few other bowlers in Pak team are equally good / better than Amir. Amir's performance against NZ was not so impressive. Since it was Ind-Pak match, Amir hit the deck with extra aggression and he was really impressive in first two overs.
In last world cup during Aus-NZ match, Southee and Boult were more impressive than Amir. Ishant/PK were also highly unplayable against mighty Aus team on their ground in few spells. From one of SL-Aus one-day match, Kula was so unplayable that Aus team were all-out in less than 80 runs. Mustafizur was also unplayable in last Ind-Bang one-day series. These one-off performances don't make any of them overnight great. 
India didn't expect Amir to bowl with such sting hence the result. Rohit is a proven mighty player with two double hundreds. He and Rahane got out exactly same way, which explains that they were not prepared for extra swing/pace. 
So, let players just play. Don't set hype. Let History and Stats prove them as winners/losers.

It seems natural (but ironic) that many families celebrate the return of the prodigal son with more aplomb than the celebrate the ones who remained within the family and did all the hard yards. Worlds reaction to Amir is just that.

Families have wised up to that irony, yet they revert back to the old weakness when they see 'more yield' from that 'returnee', than from the more loyal, hard-working, but less earning ones.

Indian fans are in state of bother by this .. one of your batsmen is having problem in making comments either its Rohit who calls him a normal bowler or its Kohli who calls him a world class bowler.. by the way its nothing serious at all whatever both of them say, its their own point of view. Amir is a class act and there are many few bowlers in the world who can bring the ball late into the right handed batsmen with some sheer pace. Comparing him with Wasim Akram is not justified. Everybody has something special to deliver. There is no point in comparing a player with another..

@Eclipse0990  you nailed it 
Amir is overhyped. He is good probably best 5  but like Rohit said if track is not helpful its not that he blows everyone over. If track is helpful amir can be lethal but then so can be 10 other bowlers on helpful tracks just like ashwin is awesome on spin tracks

Amir is a bowler who relies on swing with good pace. On a green pitch, the effects are devastating. But on the same pitch, Pandya took 3-8. Does that make him great?   That was an argument awesome hit on nail argument.
</p>

@Eclipse0990  you nailed it 
Amir is overhyped. He is good probably best 5  but like Rohit said if track is not helpful its not that he blows everyone over. If track is helpful amir can be lethal but then so can be 10 other bowlers on helpful tracks just like ashwin is awesome on spin tracks

Those who are offended with what Rohit said, can you point one thing that he said wrong about Amir?  He was actually praising all Pak bowlers as equally talented.  He was actually talking to Indian media, he was telling them do not start bragging about Pak bowler while missing to see the greatness of Bumrah.  
</p>
<p>
People who are saying Bumrah will be sorted out with time, should realize how Australia missed to sort him even after playing him in 1 ODI and 3 t20s.  THey still struggled to spot him. 
</p>
<p>
For what Wasim Akram said about Amir that he is in line with him,  the same Akram also praised Irfan Pathan so much. Now he is struggling even in Indian domestic circuit. Greats like Wasim are good to spot talent, but performance should speak above talent. Rohit was considered the greatest talent even before he performed but it is only in past few years he has lived upto his potential.

Amir has already proved his capacity. Rohit may have to prove his ability of playing in big matches. I am not able to recall the last time when he played a grt knock on big match or in a must win condition.

Rohit called Amir a "normal" bowler. How many "normal" bowlers start playing international cricket at 18 years and have an average of less than 30 across all 3 formats? How many normal bowlers go through what Amir went through and are still able to come back at the top level after playing no competitive cricket for 5 years?
How many bowlers has Wasim Akram (who knows way more about bowling than Rohit) called better than himself? Amir has a long way to go before he can be called great but he certainly has demonstrated all the signs to become one. Why not acknowledge and appreciate what Amir has shown so far just based on our conjunctures on what will happen to him in the future or on flat pitches?

Amir is a bowler who relies on swing with good pace. On a green pitch, the effects are devastating. But on the same pitch, Pandya took 3-8. Does that make him great? I guess not. So let's get some perspective here, guys. You bash Rohit because he said something about your national icon which you don't like. But isn't he hyped up for that one spell of 2 overs when ball was swinging like crazy? Yes. There is potential and all but that has been his pinnacle after return. Hype him when he does it again and does so in less helpful conditions. Steyn did so. Wasim and Waqar did so. Macgrath did so. Let him do so as well. Then he can earn respect from batsmen. Then I'd not defend him either. Also, for twice out in two balls, it was first time Rohit and Rahane played him. Kohli had time to adjust. If he does so again while bowling to them, then I will say that he is good. He does so over and over, he is great. But not now. :)

Why must rohit make himself look this way again. Amir is a world class bowler who destroyed england and aus in england and Sanga+Mahela SL in SL. He has proven everything he needs to. When rohit scores a hundred at Super Sport Park or Leeds, the he can talk. Delusional India players always do this when they have the backing of the ground staff. India is the #1 team......................until a tour of England, SA, NZ or Australia.Virat however is the real deal

I think Kohli is clever in that he commends the Pakistani bowling attack, with the knowledge that media spin will over hype and therefore place pressure on Pak bowlers to perform, and we all know how Pakistan team can crack when pressure to perform against India is on. Rohit is therefore speaking as an emotional Indian, and unnecessarily putting Bumrah into the media spotlight, I think India team management will be having some sharp words!

Mr. Inconsistent feels left out and now and many of you folks are saying that consistency shows real value...
*Check his stats...His first 3 years, averaging around 20 with 4 Fifties, 0 Centuries, after playing 40+ matches.  
*After 100 matches, he had scored 2 Centuries.  Consistency, are you kidding me?  Just because you have done well for the last couple years, we havnt forgotten the horrendous start to the career.  When you didnt perform, LEGENDS and media were all over you and asked for them to take a step back.  So you want others to go through a similar experience even though they are performing?  Classy...not!
</p>
<p>
If Virat (a real legend already) says he is world class, then I would believe that ANY day.  Amir is an excellent bowler and I am positively surprised by the emergence of Bumrah.  They should both be allowed to play fearless cricket away from the likes of negative nancy's A.K.A Rohit Sharma.  Instead of making statements, maybe spend some more time in the nets dude.

bumrah is absoloutely lucky that he has not bowled to  many good batsmen .its just a matter of time when players start recognizing his bowling and thrash him to all parts of the ground .he is not even a good bowler let alone a great .

Rohit is right Amir is a good bowler no doubt but people are getting excited too early. In the Asia Cup against India he bowled two unbelievable overs when there was swing on offer. but once the swing had gone he was pretty predictable and playable so stop hyping him around. Even Wahab had bowled an unbelievable spell in world cup against australia but after that he has not produce same intensity as such. Bumrah st the other hand has come out with better figures  calmly without any hype or so.  In the same match where every one was talking about amir bumrah prouced a spell of 3 overs -8runs -1 wicket.  and too add to that he bowled 16 dot bowls of 18 but it went unoticed because of the first 2 over spell of amir.

Mohammad Amir is a normal bowler,. Every now and then, there are bowlers who bowl very good spell and that's what he did on a particular day. But other than that he is an ordinary bowler. But if he does it again and again he will come in line with legends like wasim akram &amp; waqar yunus. But a single spell on a helping wicket doesn't make him  a great bowler. Its very simple. I don't know why many people fail to simply understand the very simple thing.

Mohammad amir is no doubt a rare talent and a quality bowler ! the reason is only few of the rarest bowlers who can bring the ball back in to the right hander at the pace of 147kph...........any batsman will get out for those kind of deliveries ! rohit sharma dont have any idea ........this is coming from indian

Find it very strange to compare Bumrah with bowlers like Amir and Malinga. In my opinion there is no comparison.

Remembers me also "hype" created around Bhuvneshwar Kumar in India - Pakistan series 2012-13. Where is he today? He is not even on the bench for India World T20 2016 squad.

Mark my words and see where Bumrah is in 3 -4 years from now. He will not even be on the bench for India at that time. That's my opinion.

If the statement given in this article are accurate than Rohit just can handle praise for a Pakistani bowler. I'm sorry Rohit but Pakistan has a track record for producing great fast bowlers so if we talk about a bowler who is doing well then not only India but the World should listen ! I agree 100% that Aamer needs to show consistency and he has a long way to go before being compared to Akram but according to Akram Aamer is up there with him and Waqar as far as talent goes, but what would Wasim Akram know about fast bowling ?
As far as Rohit's statement about Bumrah is concerned I think he bowled great in the Asia Cup but like Aamer he had favorable pitches apart from that Rohit just isn't qualified to talk of fast bowling, he still has a flat track reputation and Aamer exposed him easily, India hyped up Irfan Pathan the same way, what did he accomplish? M Shami is plagued with injuries. So It's hard for me to take Rohit Sharma seriously.

Paki fans have gone crazy over Rohit's comment.. No doubt Amir is a very good bowler but to call him "expectional" or "as great as Wasim" is such a shame...!! Fast bowling is not everything to do with skills.. It requires mental conditioning,diet,training etc. Just raw talent won't take u far.. Only time will tell how great Amir will be after he plays 50 odd Tests and around 150 odd ODIs. We all saw how Amir was missing his swing in NZ recently and so was rendered ineffective. Let him play matches on flat pitches and we can judge for ourselves including Rohit himself.One more reason we hype these youngsters so much (including Rabada,Bumrah,Chameera etc.) is coz we haven't seen quality fast bowling around the world for a long time (except few occasional events).. Talks a lot abt the lack of quality pace battery around the world..

Rohit Sarma is absolutely right. Amir is good bowler in Pakistan but not very best to compare with legend like wasim Akram. Media is mostly responsible mostly for this to make amir a great bowler of Pakistan which is ridiculous to me. Actually, I am not saying he is good bowler but he need to prove to be a great bowler through consistent performance.

This is the difference between Rohit n Kohli.... kohli is world class n humble not very talented but hard worker n achiever.... n Rohit even though being more talented hasnt lived up to the potential because of this kind of attitude..... i know rohit wud score runs against amir now on flat wickets n then give pathetic remarks again but i hope he dsnt n amir gets him again cheaply

bro don't fight plz one thing I want to say amir very good but can't disregard wasim after comparing with him .amir very good but one spell can't make him great similar thing happens to wahab raiz .pitch was so helpful that part timer like pandhya was running side with 8-3 .sunil gavaskar bowled zaheer Abbas with a zaffar but that bowl can't make him great bowler similarly hansie outlast sachin many times where worlds best bowlers struggles. so one innings is too short to judge .march 19 will solve all ur queries as it won't be green top .dharamshala is known to have one of the flattest track in India no disregard absolutely vice versa of mirpur .no disregard he is better than bumrah as he is a test match bowler not a limited over bowler like bumrah but rohit is also class player.remember sachin vs warne 1 first time warne get better of sachin but after sachin tonked him all over according to warne he got nightmares of sachin.plz wait till march 19 and if there is a true pak fan they know that we want to be strong so that rivarly remains stronger.don't happy to defeat weak pak side that easily .Ind pak match should bd Ind pak match nail baiter as always.

Hes absolutely right. Consistency is what proves your worth. it is too soon to talk about him. Amir was handled by bangladesh, who has yet to qualify for W20 cup. To all his fans, trophies talk, efforts only make noise. Good luck in t20 cup with Amir. Dont blame the tracks ...rohit will smash him around the ground no doubt about that. He is a genuine cricketer and has proved it over and over, witu two double hundreds up his sleeves. Amir hasn't won a match with his performance. Simple as that.

I too agree with Rohit. I also felt that Amir did not do anything serious to win all those hype. He bowled those 2 overs very well against India, but after that even Kolhi took him apart as well. He ended with figures poorer than Bumrah.  Rest of the games also he did not run though the sides as others predicted. 
He is a good bowler who can bowl good spell.
Rohit also did not speak anything against Amer, he only said do not keep hyping about him because of just 2 overs in one spell. Talk about your own pace spearhead Bumrah who is creating waves.  We Indians admire bowlers from other nation but not our own.  We kind of believe that our bolwers are not as good as others. It is not true. On a spinning track Ashwin is the best spinner in the world.  In death overs Bumrah is doing great job. Lets start to appeciate our talents.

02/27: Rohit and Rahane opening the innings, Amir to bowl from over the wicket.
</p>
<p>
0.1 Mohammad Amir to Sharma, no run, Pakistan cannot believe that isn't lbw! Amir has bowled a scorching yorker, angling across the right-hander and then bending back to hit the toe of the front foot. That looks so good. I think Rohit is really lucky ...
0.2
</p>
<p>
Mohammad Amir to Sharma, OUT, Amir's got him this time! Another incredible ball, slanting across Rohit at pace from over the wicket, pitching on a good length around off and bending back into the right-hander, beating the inside edge of the bat to crash into the pad. The umpire takes a while but eventually sends Rohit on his way. Two outstanding balls from Amir. That one is crashing into middle stump
</p>
<p>
RG Sharma lbw b Mohammad Amir 0 (2m 2b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
</p>
<p>
03/08: Rohit - "Amir is an ordinary bowler".
</p>
<p>
03/19 - Rohit has nothing much left to say after the game. Neither does Amir - he has let his ball do the talking.

The hype around Aamir is not justifiable, he came good on green pitch &amp; bowled beautifully...but the hype is not good...our Indian bowlers also bowled well, especially Bumrah, who is very inexperienced...waiting how aAamir bowl on pitches which less helpful for bowlers here in India...Mar 18 will be a good day for cricket

Also, the fact that he was able to come back after 5 years and continue where he left off is freakish. Plus I guess 'doing it over and over again' argument doesn't apply to Bumrah and he's a world class bowler already?

i think what rohit sharma says is absolutely right. just one incredible spell after a comeback doesnt mean  amir is an exceptional bowler. he still has a long way to go .in the whole asia cup,his best performance was against india on pitch which had the maximum grass on it . rest of the matches he couldnt generate tht much swing. there r still many challenges for amir to cross.lets see how he does in good batting wickets. n all those people saying tht rohit is a flat track bully r just idiots n dont know about cricket.he has an average of around 39 in new zealand which is great n he has played many  match winning knocks in seaming pitches which people dont even notice.so what he said is right tht amir still needs to prove himself in different pitches!

"Bumrah is already starting to make a mark. I would tell you that instead of talking about Amir you should talk about Bumrah"  . Rohit , u shouldn't have told that. Amir was called a world class bowler by kohli who stood in that fiery spell. U were lucky to not given out in the first ball. It takes a lot of effort to bowl a perfect yorker in a very first ball. U should not decide who is best or not .There are other bowling legends to call that . Amir was a comeback man .Salute to him .

Rohit is right.  Other than the game against India, Amir's performance in the other games was not out of this world. Of course he is a very good bowler and I really hope he keeps up his performance. But let us not compare him to Akram yet.

Lets see if any reasonable, sane, decent person agrees with Sharma.

Also, Sharma wouldn't know how good Amir is, especially considering the fact that both bowls Amir bowled to him, Sharma was out.

No doubt Amir is a world class bowler but comparing to Akram is not fair at all. Akram is a legend and was a great bowler. Rohit said that he is normal bowler because of his normal action. Amir will face real test world cup when flat pitch will be provided for all team. Amir will struggle like steyn.

I have only seen Bumrah in one match and he does look promising. Many of his deliveries look ok but certain deliveries do seem to contain an overflexing of his arm. I would not be surprised if an ICC umpire decides to call for a biomechanical assessment soon.

I support Rohit Sharma's statement that comparing Mohammed Amir to Wasim Akram is not at all justifiable bur Mohammed Amir is way better then Jaspirit Bumrah. Couldn't he learn something from Virat Kohli and either praise your opponent or be quiet.

The reason you can't predict Bumrah is because he himself doesn't know what and where he is going to bowl. As far as Amir is concerned, I would hate to get lbw'd twice in 2 consecutive deliveries. Prove something against him and prove it with your actions rather than words. 
Rather you are pretty much over-rated yourself. Never seen you play well against pakistan. Even in 2006 U19 final you got bowled over by Anwar Ali.

Rohit wanted to compliment his Mumbai Indian players. Good for them. I agree with the fact that Amir is being hyped. He is a good bowler. Thats it. He will also have hid bad days. We will see what he will do on spinning pitches in India.

Of course Amir is brilliant but one look at his stats and you'll find that there are many current bowlers better than him. His present reputation is mostly warranted by his infamy. I think we should leave Pak fans to treat/hype Amir however they want, the higher you go, the harder you fall. And please don't disregard Wasim Akram by comparing Amir with him, he has not achieved even a tenth of what the great man has done.

Very Funny. Rohit better you should send a Thanks note to Umpire who tried to save you on first delivery of AMIR but alas he couldn't on second. The Hype is created around you that you are are a great batsman just scoring on dead wickets. You are nothing more than ordinary player.

if Amir is a normal bowler and Bumrah called a rare talent then i think Rohit was out of his cricketing sens.
and this is also showing the narrow mentality against Pakistani bowlers.
if he is just a normal bowler then why Indain top order collapse with in 10Runs.
and why Virat is praising him ? Virat is a better batsman then Rohit.

Last time Rohit faced him, he managed to survive two balls and he was out on both of them. Amir is in a class of his own and if Rohit wants to be a great batsman, he needs to admit that like Kohli did. Downplaying one of the most exciting fast bowlers of our time isn't going to earn him any respect.

If Amir is a normal bowler, Rohit is a sub-par batsman. I say Amir is a rare talent, and Rohit can be devastating on his days (hardly happens in tests, no cribs about ODIs and T20s)

I guess Rohit is embarrassed because he could not figure out Amir and only lasted two balls thus the statement.  I am sure Bumrah is good but let's not compare him with Amir yet.  To early to call Amir great and compare him to Wasim but he definitely is the hottest fast bowler around today whether Rohit likes it or not.

'normal' bowlers don't take 51 test wickets  (including 3 five fors) before they can legally drive or drink. I don't know if Amir is the same class as an Akram or Waqar, but let's wait and see if Bumrah can achieve the same or similar when or IF he's good enough for test cricket. but from what I saw from Amir in the past, he's the most naturally gifted bowler going around in international cricket at the moment and he's yet to really hit his peak.

Every bowler has his day, when the pitch and conditions favors the bowling. If a bowler uses the conditions to his advantage, that is a PLUS for the team. What Amir did on that day is very special, given his return to international matches representing PAK after his ban. So now the onus is on Amir to show consistently that he is the bowler to watch out for PAK and a challenge for all the batsmen across all teams.

Amir is a great talent and people like Rohit Sharma who still can't play swing or seam movement after 9 years of international cricket (he is amazing against the straight ball though) shouldn't have said that. Anyway, Bumrah is a very good bowler because he can seam it (not swing but seam) both ways. Only bowlers from sub-continent who can seam it both ways in last 25 years are/were Asif, Dhammika Prasad, Venkatesh Prasad and Jaspreet Bumrah. Of these Asif could swing it both ways too. But only Dhammika and Bumrah bowl consistently over 140k. Prasad used to bowl the slowest at 125-130k. Asif between 130-137k. Akram (an all time great), Waqar (a great), Zaheer Khan (world class between 2007-11) and Chaminda Vaas (very good) could swing it both ways and reverse it both ways but they hardly got any seam movement.

I agree with Rohit to a certain extent but overall Amir is a World class Bowler. He can be slotted with Boult, Anderson &amp; Broad in the present day bowlers. But Starc, Steyn &amp; M.Johnson are little ahead in terms of quality. Amir was really good in the Ind-Pak match bcoz the conditions was highly favorable to Swing bowling in the initial 5-6overs. In the next match on a typical Sub-continent pitch Amir returned with figures of 0/31 in 4 overs againsta weak SL team, that justifies the quality of Amir to some extent. In Normal conditions he is a good bowler not an exceptional one.

He was beaten first ball and out the second ball and yet calls him normal. U must give the credit where it is due Rohit and Amir deserves the credit. Rohit after playing 10 over looks lazy, tired and running short of breathe. Its painful to watch him after 10 overs. Rohit only plays well when the wicket is flat like in India or in Australia.

I do not know if Amir is the same bowler now as he was in 2010. He was brilliant in 2010.One or 2 T20  innings may not be good enough (and same can be said about Bumrah) It is too early to judge Bumrah. Time will tell how good these bowlers will have become. But I would pick Amir right now based on his experience. May be Rohit sharma did not mean to disrespect him (like How Imran khan used to say Sachin was never a match winner which many Indians may not agree). It was probably  a response to question from persisting journalists

Virat and Rohit might be correct in their own assessments. Mind you, they themselves are undisputed world class. But for Amir to be tagged with that superlative unanimously, he has a few more grounds and years to scale. Something that Akram, Steyn, Donald etc. had done. What we are seeing right now is a trailer. Time will tell if we are in for a blockbuster or a dud. Lets wait and watch. He is at least, worthy of that.

What we are seeing right now is a trailer. Time will tell if we are in for a blockbuster or a dud. Lets wait and watch. He is at least, worthy of that.

lol, one spell against India with a new ball on a green seaming pitch and everyone is comparing Amir with greats like Wasim Akram. As Rohit said he needs to do what he did with consistency, he took seven wickets in 4 match out of which 3 came in the same match against India, so he took only 4 wickets with other 3 opponents, that seems like an average

what Rohit said was right. amir was effective because conditions suited him. on a flat pitch even he struggled, same applies for bumrah

Wow, rohit really is hurt about what happened to him in the golden duck where he was out twice and first time not given. Is he really comparing Amir to Bumrah? Smh. Really no sportsmanship to give the credit where it's due.

Although I feel the same way(because he has been normal mostly since his comeback and only did well on the green pitches), I don't think a batsman should be making such comments in public. It just shows how arrogant Rohit Sharma is.

these are the tactics to demoralize amir, but hopefully it will boostup the confidence of the pacer. moreover amir had proved  from 2007 to 2010, and also in 2015 , he is consistent and treat to watch.

Bangladesh handled him pretty well. I don't see him doing anything noteworthy as he doesn't bowl yorkers in death and can't swing the bowl both ways. He's like left handed Dale Steyn, maybe he could become a top Test bowler, but he's not clever or should I say versatile enough to be successful in limited overs.

Rohit know indian pitches would neutralize Aamir to some extent thats why he openly downgrading him...Rohit ironically u urself have very poor record on bowling friendly pitches and against quality bowling. u also have to prove yourself...Getting runs on asian and australian road-turned pitches will not make u sachin or Lara...so improve ur own poor record against good quality bowling and on bowling friendly pitches every where the world consistently for 10 12 years then u will be qualified as a great otherwise u are just a normal batsman .!!

Before people go out all guns blazing here, I am going to support Rohit's statement. Read it out. A bowler has to prove that he is good in every innings. Every match and every innings is different from the ones behind and ones to come. If you don't do good in a match, you're of no use even if you are a good bowler. However, Mr Sharma, this applies to you as well. You need to prove over and over that you are a good batsman. A failure in an innings also means that you are not useful in that innings even if you have "malleable wrists, oozing talent, that extra second"(according to espncricinfo profile). So lets keep it humble, shall we?

Yuvi is still a game changer when it matters most, he will not waste time like Sir Jaddu did. He can hit big sixes out of nowhere, Dhoni will use him when needed, so far he is not really required to do much as frontline batters are doing well. Yuvi is very experienced and playing his last WC. He is still a decent fielder and a good bowler in Subcontinent.

Feeble opponents alright, but does matter when you were 52/3 in 10 overs. Problem is there are players in every team who are overrated for T20s.
Examples are Dhawan and Yuvraj for India, Smith, Maxwell, for Australia, Bangladesh an entire team...

@SauravJain You forget that your favorite player Ravindra Jadeja lost us WT20 in 2009 and 2010. Without him, India would have certainly reached the semi-finals in both those occasions. Jadeja is unplayable on rank turners and very good on pitches that turn but he is useless when it doesn't turn. No flight, no dip and no drift. He is a part-timer on those pitches. Pandya on other hand is very raw but I have repeatedly said on this forum that talent-wise he is the best seam-bowling all-rounder since Manoj Prabhakar. Pandya has demonstrated that he can play the cover drive, square cut and straight drive in domestic cricket but unfortunately you Sir, never bother to watch domestic cricket.

It's not that Yuvraj isn't playing upto potential. It's that Yuvraj is long past his prime (similar to MSD; though MSD can still make it work somewhat but Yuvraj can't as unlike MSD who can play because of his keeping Yuvraj doesn't have a great second skill to fall back on). Even if Yuvraj scores 40 off 20 in next game I will still say the same thing. He will never again be consistently brilliant as he used to be especially between 2005-2008 (or even WC 2011). And since his comeback from cancer he has been a shadow of the batsman he used to be.

Rohit is an awesome batsman in shorter formats and sooting to watch. My concern is on Yuvi (die hard fan) as he is already selected in the T20 WC team and Dhoni will definitely pick him over Ajinkya for his alrounder skills and better ability as pinch hitter than Rahane.  He needs to perform now to prove his worth and trust of his captain and selectors, otherwise it is unfair to deserved youngsters who are knocking the national team doors with their performances and skills at U19, India A and RanJi level.

Hardik is a Yusuf Pathan type player. I am sure opposition's will surely ploy some bowling strategy for him He has not proven on quality spinners or quality seemers though. Secondly Yuvi should feel from his own that Manish Pandey,Jadeja ,Uthappa ,Sarfaraj etc are waiting for there chances. Selectors should prefer current form and talent rather than yesteryear superstardom.

@Oldtimer01 That was a bad delivery which Rohit played to Shakib. The rest of the over also of short and wide deliveries. Rohit would be very unlucky to get out to such poor bowling. The bowler deservedly got punished after that.

I like the way Bangladeshi's have made some good strides in cricket, but I still feel there is a lot of scope for improvement. First step is respecting the opposition, and the folks who do that are their star performers like Sakib and Mushfiq. Second step is not experimenting when pitted against high quality opposition. Thirdly, accepting the fact that there will be more losses than victory and hopefully you learn out of it and improve in the subsequent matches. Finally, every different bowler will have an initial period when he succeeds, later once the opposition works him out he will be found wanting if he does not have a good stock delivery. Mustafizur needs to work on his stock delivery and not just rely too much on his well change of pace, else he will be exposed just like Ajantha Mendis who was difficult to play during his initial days.

Finally, every different bowler will have an initial period when he succeeds, later once the opposition works him out he will be found wanting if he does not have a good stock delivery. Mustafizur needs to work on his stock delivery and not just rely too much on his well change of pace, else he will be exposed just like Ajantha Mendis who was difficult to play during his initial days.

Gee, Bangladesh get a thrashing and  a bunch of Indian players pad their stats against a weak team in a meaningless game. How often does that happen?

Bangladesh will never fare well as long as the Captain keeps bowling his 4 overs and gifts the opposition "40 runs". He does it without fail and no one says a word. T20 is about containing runs in addition to scoring. There is no other Captain in the world who hogs the bowling like Mashrafe does and gets hit all over the cow corner. But Bangladeshis love Mash and he can do no wrong. So be prepared for two more thrashings - one from Pakisatan and the other from SLanka. Their batsmen can't wait to give Mash his full quota of 40 runs and maybe 1 wicket.

Bangla Played great in bowling department. I think it was great effort but buckled under pressure from Rohit and Pandya. Looks like Bangla is going to miss tamim more and more in Asia cup. Its going to be uphill task for Bangla to win against Pak and SL with there current batsmen. Batting line up also needs fine tuning for Bangla. Why would u have kayes bat for 24 balls for just 14 . Bowling is real strength of this Bangla team but doesn't look like they are going to fare well until they can fix.  Question for  MM when did you see green tops helping cutters? By having green top you nullified mustafiz effect :)  India needs to rotate there batsmen(5 6 7). Guess Pandya can be sent even higher at number 5.  Need some practice to Jaddu also. Yuvi needs to be tried at 6 or 7 . Yuvi at 5 is looking bad at the moment . But these are good problems to have . Its like Morris performing better than middle order for SA. Finally for all Dreamers just wait and watch how it unravels on 27th go blue!!

Bangla played well.

<p>
Indian top order played the same way yet to an another moving ball attack apart from Rohit. But he also gave a chance.
</p>
<p>
Cricket fans who argue that the dropped catch won India this match, not thinking through it. Agree that it was lucky for Rohit. Had it been taken the match could have gone either way. That being said there is no is and buts in any sport. It is an amaturish discussion point. That's all.
</p>
<p>
About end of match comment from Bangla captain, how can he expect a 15 over ball to behave differently on a green pitch. It shows lack of experience. More matches will give more experience to him. The less said about Banla btting disaster it's better. 
</p>
<p>
To my fellow Indian fans, keep your head levelled whether we win or loose. It's good for your health and  the sport.

BD fans are like its cricket team, too much of optimism but no real results with loads of excuse.Catch dropped, no ball not given etc., hope they dont claim foul play that why the opposition batsmen not letting the ball hit the stumps for clean bowled. BD cricket still deserves to be termed as minnows with no achievement so far(abysmal test record, No. 10 T20 side, 2-3 ODI series victory in 3 decades)

IND played like No.1 T20 side &amp; BD played much better than No.10 side which is a positive sign. BD fans expecting their team to win against mighty IND is too optimistic.Honestly there is no comparison between two sides. For that matter Pak &amp; SL would also prove too much for BD as they just don't seem to have any quality in their batting. BTW can anyone tell me that why BD didn't have to go through the qualification round as they are lower ranked T20 side than Afghans.

@MATTCASTELINO: This match could have headed in a much more robust direction in India's favour had Dhawan, Kohli and Raina not thrown their wickets so easily. I am convinced India's bowling and and batting are more than adequate for this tournament. BD could not take advantage of 1) home ground (Tiger's den), 2)their own green track trap for India, 3) They were poor in all three departments, i.e., Fielding (Catch miss), Batting (no hard hitting and confident risk takers), and bowling (Mustafizur was a complete flop). Also, please do not forget the umpire gave a benefit of doubt to Sabbir.

So  called IPL product Hardik Pandya has done well so far for India, all my fellow Indian who despise IPL have often had this weird logic to blame IPL for every Indian defeat but very conveniently forget to credit IPL when India wins (Lot of ICC Silverware and numerous bilateral series,number one ranking at various times) since IPL started in 2008 . I urge this lot to approach IPL with bit more maturity and objectivity .

I feel yuvraj innings was also enough.. He might not have provided the required t20 charge.. But just think another wicket at that moment would not have stabilised the innings..hardik pandya continued from were yuvraj left.. That yuv-rohit partnership provided the foundation required for pandya.. But India have assess raina ASAP.. He was charging at the bowlers without any technique.. Just throwing away his bat at every thing.. Just not reading the ball at all..

Rather then getting too emotional, BD should concentrate more on learning. Hire some better analyst and study how other teams specially India approach T20 format. 
IMO their chances against Pak are better. On a wicket like this Pak would find it hard to score or chase 100.

This is the second level for Bangladesh!! Last year was the first level, which they passed with flying colors against Eng/ Pak/ Ind and SA. But the next level of sustaining your triumph is more tougher. If BD loses to SL and PAK then they are back to where they started. I am saying this because Rajitha and Amir from SL and Pak respectively are more sharper than a certain Bumrah or Nehra.

Bangladesh coaching staff are useless in T20s as most of the Bangladesh players.Same
old story in T20s yet again.Again failed to chase 160 in T20s.Bangladesh's highest
chase in T20s is 160 against West Indies way back in 2007.So why they choose to
bowled first? Next time Open the batting with Mushfiq and sommo followed by sabbir
and mahmudullah.Why they dropped Nurul Hasan from the last series? He was very
successful down the order.I don't want to write anything on sakib.Mashrafi should
drop himself from the team.He is useless.

@Khaskheli Raja - Brother also think of Pakistani Batsman. At least India have Rohit and Kohi at the top who can see of difficult face with their reasonably good technique. India's bowler who are not as good on flat tracks start looking threatening on green tops. So India won't mind green tops.

@AIZIKHAN i can not recall Bangladesh has ever won any tournament having more than 4 teams in any format of games or a test match apart from ZIM and WI (when they were at decline ) . if you have improved this much in 20  years . God knows how long you will be in a position when teams like India and England will consider you to invite to play a test match . 
They don't want to host you because if you can't even draw matches at home , what will happen when you will visit there .
Win something  to show the world . One or 2 matches here and there will not earn respect of the opposition . 
When India took you seriously from 3rd ODI match , you can see the results. You will once again start loosing  like you did after a victory over India in 2007.
Where is the progress friend. Show me the figures

Actually,if a team drops a catch,it's not just the oppositions luck,it's POOR FIELDING.And a team which fields poorly shouldn't complain of bad luck.I wish Afghanistan had been playing too.They seem to be a really good side.

India played excellent cricket especially Rohit who analysed the conditions and played sensibly when the ball was darting around and then was ably supported by Yuvraj who is yet to find his touch but built a good partnership with Rohit. Hardik Pandya played exciting cricket and might be the key in late overs for Indian team.
</p>
<p>
Coming to Bangladesh, I thought they lost the match inside the dressing room only when they saw they have to chase 166 on this green wicket. As all experts say that your best batsmen should bat the maximum no of balls but bangladesh approach was totally the opposite. Shakib, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur should bat in the top 5 as they are their best batsmen but came at 5, 8, 6 respectively. They have a good bowling line up for green as well as dry pitches but needs to sort their batting line up.

Coming to Bangladesh, I thought they lost the match inside the dressing room only when they saw they have to chase 166 on this green wicket. As all experts say that your best batsmen should bat the maximum no of balls but bangladesh approach was totally the opposite. Shakib, Mahmudullah, Mushfiqur should bat in the top 5 as they are their best batsmen but came at 5, 8, 6 respectively. They have a good bowling line up for green as well as dry pitches but needs to sort their batting line up.

Bangladesh are a descent odi and t20 team but I would they still suck big time because of their test cricket performance. Even after playing test cricket for more than 15 years they have defeated is Zim and WI. I believe they should focus more in their basics instead of focussing on these short term goals of winning T20s and ODIs

As Nehra said, from his first over, it was known to the team that we will defend 166. What were BD thinking, by keeping wickets in hand till the last ball ? Not sure they were aware of the run rate factor.

Indian fans pls be humble in defeat &amp; just enjoy the performance. We were humbled by a new-look SL side not too long ago. Rohit was a costly drop for Bangladesh other there was a good chance of a closer match although India were firm favorites. Bangladesh fans please give the deserved credit to India. Based on your eye-catching &amp; consistent performances during the last 12 months in limited overs, (including CWC in Australia), no team in their right frame of mind can take you lightly, especially in subcontinental conditions! So yes, best of luck to all teams for Asia cup. Looking forward to memorable battles ahead.

India luckily managed to score 166 because of dropped catch of rohit by sakib otherwise India would have bundled out for 120 runs and Bangladesh could have won the match easily

Rahim should open  with Sarker in absence of Tamim if BD team MGT opt to retain lft-rgt combination for not sending regular opener like Kayes, This will give Mushfiq enough time to set with the wkt and play shots later. after losing so may wkts cheaply he barely can play his natural game with the pressure to increase the run rate. BD bowlers need to learn death bowling with yorker and  slow bouncer. Taskin tried his best to bowl as quick as he can costing him the line-length accuracy. Mustafiz didn't try a single fast yorker. Mash as always couldn't control his emotions after get beaten and lost the way where to bowl? and Shakib.....? played the most amateurish game we have ever seen. He was everywhere but nowhere!

The most sad part is BD think they have McGraths and Gillepies in their team and thought if they roll out a green top Ind will fold like pack of cards..but unfortunately they fell into their own trap. Sadly they neither have a good bowling attack or batting to perform in a green top. Score 150+ and put BD to bat that is enough for them.... There is a reason why Ind whitewashed Aus (T20) in their own backyard hope now BD would have realized..anyways best of luck for the rest of the matches...

IND have an ideal mix of youth &amp; experience to dominate the Asia Cup &amp;  T20WC 2016 tournaments. IND's top 4 batsmen have to manage the power play risks adequately &amp; bowlers will have to plan to contain big hitters in opposition teams &amp; fielders will have to support the bowlers. In the match v BD top 4 batters did not manage the power play risks adequately. But for the dropped catch of Rohit the match would have been much closer. Rohit &amp; Pandaya deserve credit to take IND to a strong total. Bowlers led by Ashish Nehra put in an excellent performance to pave way for an easy win. Rohit is taking great strides as a batsman &amp; should be regular member of test team at No. 6. There is no merit in arguments of some critics &amp; experts in selective criticism of some players &amp; captain over last 1 year. If IND play to full potential in Asia Cup 2016 &amp; T20 WC 2016 title wins should not be difficult.

The most expected happened last night as bangladesh was not even near to create a miracle. I think its hardtime that ICC should take steps to remove the Test status of Underwhelming Bangla side. Bangladesh is not even capable of competing in a comprehensive manner. They are a Blot on the image of Other Asian supremacies like Ind, pak and SL

Bangladesh deserved a thrashing in the hands of giants India and their stratergy backfired. No doubt, their odi team had a very good year 2015. It doesn't they will always win against India. Forget about beating India, I don't think they will beat SL or PAK.

If Rohit wasn't dropped, it would've been different. If Tamim was playing, BD could've chased even 200. If it had not rained, BD could've made even 300 batting first. Really? There's no external factors (umpires, etc) to blame, so you're blaming Sakib and calling India lucky? LOL, if it wasn't Rohit, who knows Dhoni would've given BD a royal thrashing along with Pandya and Pandya could've got a fifty and 200+ was easily on cards. Stop giving excuses, accept the better team won.

Guys, this is cricket and there is no scope for ifs and buts. Dhawan is once in a blue moon player and he should be replaced with Rahane, which gives solidity to the opening pair. And yesterday, it was a seemingly green track, and it created enough problems during the earlier part of the Indian innings, and which it should be on a green top. So loosing Virat, who otherwise is having a fine run, was an odd blemish. As manjeraker put out, its really the middle order batting that is worrisome unlike our bowling as in the past. Raina, still find hiccups with short balls, and Yuvraj, Dhoni etc are not the enforcers they were and you need decent number of matches to assess H Pandiya, though he was good yesterday. India's progress will depend heavily on how the top order carries their rich vein of form, or how the middle order finally gets in the groove. Nehra, Bumrah, Pandiya looks okie as pacers and Aswin, Jadeja with all those bags of tricks is more than handy.

For me the best shot of the whole match was when rohit sharma whacked rather unconventionally but still effectively. Mustafizur rehmaan for six over the long leg boundry.that shot shows that you need to use your brain to while facing a bowler like rehmaan and not commit yourself into the shot.

Brilliant innings by Rohit Sharma on a tough pitch . now hopefully people will stop calling him the flay track bully. He never was one .just some stupid people would call him.India need  a. Reliable no.4 raina  doesn't use his common sense while playing he just goes for shots every ball. Yuvi was unlucky to miss out a big score today.and hardik pandya playing fearlessly n building that crucial partnership with Rohit was a joy to watch . one thing that was disappointing were the BD fans they never appreciate the opposition team . not even a single clap . that's very dissapointing to see

Congrats India! 
I need all the BD supporters to do a reality check. While we have played some good games against the India, by no means we are in the same league as them. And there should not be any expectation that we have to win against them every time. They have been playing cricket for nearly 80 years now, they have got the biggest of pool of players in the world, and they have invested most amount of money in cricket than any other countries. Indians should not be too happy with a win against BD. You SHOULD win 9 out of 10 times. Bangladesh should set their target to win against Sri Lanka, New Zealand (in our condition), West Indies and possibly against Pakistan and England (in our condition). We need to win regularly against them. We can catch up with India soon, but there is nothing wrong losing against them. We need to learn from our mistakes. We need to find the right players for T20. We should not put the burden of expectations on young guns like Mustafiz. Enjoy Asia cup!!

(a) overconfident BD, will remain overconfident in preparing themselves for tournaments where India plays them.
(b) the complain box BD fans, talking about a missed catch, lucky IND fans, if shabbir was given LBW yesterday, these guyz wud have started another controversy. 
(c) Mustafizur - their strike bowler struggled against a good batting. He was new and mystery to the world when anybody makes debut. Accept Ind had a tough time, that doesnt mean that Ind Batsman or thinktank wont work on him. Let him prove his mettle when he comes India for wct20. Look at his figure. 4-0-40-0. All wold class bowlers has proved themselves in India pitches. by making pitches like this, they will not win one match even in asia cup. Pak and SL has better Pace dept than BD. 
(d)BD batting - sucks... except shabbir(who looked bit confident), all others proved, rise of tigers is far far away. atleast 20-30years. Mahmudullah looks class.. Except than good luck BD fans.

P.S. How rude some Indians are. Seriously boys. BD is a big team now. They beat you so easily and also Pakistani Team. You gotta accept your massive defeat and give credit to BD players. They were almost in the finals of WC if that No-Ball decision wasn't made. I strongly agreed with the point that BD is a big team now. It is just matter of time that they did not perform well yesterday. So what? India doesn't perform much outside India. All the best to BD team for rest of Asia CUP.

bad news is BD trapped on their green pitch policy agaist best batting lineup...but good news is they still managed to get 120  score which I M sure SL won't able to do it... PAK is unpredictable cause new batting line up..BD gonna win agaist SL,UAE easily...but they will hv tough time agaist PAK bowlers... at the end result looks like this..1)india 2)pak 3)BD 4)UAE 5)SO

Pathetic show by Bangladeshi batsmen. Although bowlers tried their level best and 167 target was an acceptable target considering indian batting line which i was expecting would have scored around 190. Anyhow, BD players must realize that it is not always what it looks like. At least you people must show what have you learned from BPL. Show some confidence against average indian bowling.  Indians are so in form now a days. But what about Somaya Sarkar? Some people were comparing his Cameo performances with Ganguly and Yesterday we all witnessed that he was unable to touch the ball even. In my opinion, confidence is good but not over confidence. All the best for next matches. BD must win as this is their home ground.

@AMMO666, If Rohit had got out that moment, who knows what Dhoni, Jadeja and Ahwin would have done. Why you people are just one-sided by thinking like if he had got out the score would have been low. It may also had happened that India had scored 175+ with Dhoni bashing. This is cricket for you and little room for excuses as they say. Lets see what BD team is upto in next match. When Zimbabwe can drew series with you, how can you be so over-confident? Indian fans are always confident as fact support them. We know from here on India will win all the remaining three matches and it will be Ind-Pak final if rains don't do anything that make us lose because of D/L method. I am not ruling SL-Ind final but Ind will play final  and this is not an over-confident statement.

How naive of BD fans to still think that every match they lose if because of their team's own fault rather than opposition's superiority. There's a thin line between patriotism and fanaticism.

India has the best batting lineup. Dhoni shouldn't be worried about it ofcourse, so MSD can ask Yuvi to go for big shots right from t begining to put bowlers under pressure. Everybody loves yuvi because of his aggressive attack like a super man.. every player has a role and let this be yuvi's job to attack (only attack).

It is really funny to see all those comments from BD fans and some anti-India fans. When we lost ODI in Oz and made umpiring decision a reason for loss of a match that was ours actually, everyone from around the world told us there is no ifs and we are losers. Now all that so called great cricket mind people are commenting like if he didn't dropped catch, if they didn't get Yuvraj out, if 130, if 120, if 150, if Nehra had not played, if Bumrah was not played, if BCCI was a football board, if whole Indian team was not there, we would have won. So many ifs from BD/SL/Pak/RSA and some Oz fans as well whose team was beaten 3-0 recently. They also ask us to stay out when neutral teams are playing and now look at them.
</p>
<p>
Yes, BD bowlers did well in first 10 overs and then as they always did in past were not able to contain. Pitch was same but they failed to score 130 also. No way near to target. Instead of India, BD looked an over-confident side yesterday. Well done Rohit as you made us won.

Yes, BD bowlers did well in first 10 overs and then as they always did in past were not able to contain. Pitch was same but they failed to score 130 also. No way near to target. Instead of India, BD looked an over-confident side yesterday. Well done Rohit as you made us won.

Thanks Dhoni, for realizing at least now. You are the one who dropped the disciplined bowlers and preferred very erratic bowlers like Ishanth, Aaron, Umesh, +++. for many years and lost many matches in the process. You better go back for bowlers like Nehra, R P Singh, Praveen, Irfan and other seniors.

Dropped catches win matches, and this match is a clear manifestation of that saying. Rohit scored 62 more runs after being dropped at 21. Had he gone then India would have not done this many runs. Indian batting does not look that good at this moment and needs to improve.

India sent a tired team for Bangla ODI series last year...no breathing space after 4 months of World Cup &amp; IPL....result -India lost the series. Mustafizur is hailed as a hero. An energetic India takes field against Bangladesh...result - thrashing. Mustafizur 4-40-0. Normal service resumed. Next up Pakistan, will be fascinating to watch Virat vs Amir.

Actually if you have to credit for India's win, it has to be the Rohit-Yuvraj partnership that just laid solid foundation for the final assault. Yuvraj may not have significantly contributed in terms of score, but what he did was stabilising the innings along with Rohit. If you are bashing Yuvi for this, then I dont know what to say. He actually wasted opportunity in Pune by rash shot, but did well this match but clearly was unlucky as he got out to Shakib. What was required of him at that stage he did it.
Why none talking about Suresh Raina who is looking to hit six of every ball on a greenish track where some common sense is required?? He has played 10 years of international cricket and hasn't evolved as a player - great match-winner on flat batting pitches, and dry-turning sub-continent wickets. He's not proper No.4 batsman on this kind of track.

Glad that India won. Rohit-Pandya onslaught propelled India to winning position. But India cannot afford to lose too many early wickets against tougher opposition. Kohli and Raina could have enhanced India's total if they played a few overs more before going for risky shots.

Shakib Al Hasan should take a break from international cricket. He doesn't have the motivation to play for his country atm. Last time I saw him win a match for Bangladesh was in Asia Cup 2012. He has been a liability past 3 years, the only reason he's in the team because of the weird ICC ranking and his contributions pre 2013

Proven one more time, Dhawan is once in a bluemoon hit. He CAN NOT play good balls, if the ball moves around a bit, he will be a sitting duck. I have always doubted Kohli's play on a good seaming pitch. I can bet, he can not play swinging ball. Flat tracks, he will be  very good .

Dharam S Khaira - even the cricinfo commentary mentioned more than once that yuvraj's innings was a scratchy one. And it actually has been this way for the last couple of years. Yuvraj might have played well a few years back but we need to look at current form and ability, which is clearly a cause for concern.

Ashwin is bowling brilliantly- his sliders are getting deadly. Hardik Pandya is doing great. 10 out of 11 players have fitted in very well- Only one exception is Yuvraj Singh and hope he gets some good knocks and India is ready for the WT20.

So the result is out! And it was as expected...India winning comprehensively, on a green top against so called world's strongest HOME team! Well played Rohit,Pandya and well bowled nehra! Yes shakib did drop that catch but in the end these things matter and indicates who the better team is!

I think Yuvi can fit better in ODI format where no instant hitting is required. Player can take some time to get in, as yuvi likes. As far as T20 is concerned we need fresh blood of Manish Pandey who can play finisher role better than yuvi. Manish is exellent fielder too. Raina can handal the part time bowler role.

It's all Shakibs' fault who drop the catch. Otherwise Bangladesh would be chasing a target of 130. On the other hand they could have kept Yuaraj in the wicket just like Sri Lanka did in the T20 world cup final. Pandya came and changed the momentum of the game thus stole the game from Bangladesh.

Yuvi failed once more to accelarate though he tried hard. Pandya got the similar balls, we can see the diffarance. Yuvi just slow down momentum whenever he appear on crease. He take 10-15 balls to get in &amp; then throw away wicket. I am too a yuvi fan, waiting to see vintage matchwinner Yuvi. But disappointed once more. I think for No.5 spot, Rahane best in Test, Yuvi in ODI &amp; Pandey in T20. But I know as far as team is winning &amp; other players are performing, Yuvi's place is safe in T20.

Good show ,but,IF SHAKIB HAD HELD ON TO THAT CATCH????India has to be careful,especially Kohli and Raina. Raina had no need to rush so mch forward n had his goose cooked by missing the ball.
Buck up to top the table,India..Another last ball six by our Dhoni.

When I came to work in the morning, first thing I did is to login to Cricinfo to check the scores. Oh! my God!! Cant believe the forth placed team (in Asia) is thrashing the top team and the number one bowler in the world (Mustafizur) failed to collect even a solitary wicket.

Bangladesh missed Tamim Iqbal rather badly. He was the highest scoring batsman in both BPL and PSL as long as he played in both tournaments. Abu Haider the top bowler in BPL is also missing. There are a few good players, but Bangladesh team as a whole is not yet good enough for T20. Batting is the biggest worry. Rankings don't lie. Even Afghanistan and UAE have chance to beat BD in this T20 competition.

If Shakib didn't drop or Mustafizur didn't give 21 in one over, the scenario may have been otherwise. Yet whether bangladesh team win or not doesn't matter to me. I am very proud of Bangladesh team win or loose. Remember we are the Tigers!

@Bangladesh...ahem ahem...Well it's high time you should be taught a lesson or two in cricket. Till that time, you should be stripped of playing cricket with the accomplished teams and made to spend time with Nepal, Hong Kong, PNG and such other teams.
You are too bad a team.
And whats with the pin drop silence when opponents hits a boundary, when will you ever learn some discipline of being a host. Shame on you.

The Policy of BD is like "I don't care if I lose both the eyes, I want my neighbor to lose at least 1 eye". They went for a green top hopping they will win the toss and choose to bowl.  They know only this way they can prevent India from trashing BD.  So they took their chances, though their own batsman cannot handle pace.  Even after this move they still got trashed! :)
</p>
<p>
It will be good if BD continues to produce such wickets. This way BD could be a different nation from other Subcontinent pitches. But they will not have guts to play against Australia or SA or even Eng on such a pitch.

As a non-Asian I can't help wondering about the timing of this tournament. If Ind win the Asia Cup but SL win the World Cup, which will be remembered come June or July? This will surely be seen as a warm-up to the main event. Any other time, and I mean ANY, this tournament would have been far more prestigious. Wow, the cricket world has gone crazy.

If India is to win the WC T20, then Dhawan and Yuvraj need to be replaced (with Pandey and Rahane perhaps?).  Dhawan cannot play good bowling on any wicket that offers a little to the bowlers (unlike the Aussie roads) nor is he a good fielder and Yuvraj is much past his best playing days.  I hope that the selectors realize this and make changes in this series otherwise India will not win the upcoming T20 championship.

Tosses don't always win matches when two teams are not evenly stacked . In T20 loosing by more than 40 + runs is unacceptable. India was able to get out of good bowling on helpful conditions . I hope Team India goes from strength to strength. This is for my bangla friends - If that catch would have been taken bangla wouldn't have won the game . India was playing to conditions and accelerated at right time. India was going at close to 6 an over and late acceleration might still have given 140+. All other teams playing in this conditions 140-150 is more than par score. Batsmen need to apply them selves which i don't see in most of top orders in Asia cup except India . That makes a huge difference in chasing.

Yuvraj will be a weak link in this team.  His strokes are predictable.  He gets out many times playing the same shot!!!  He is unable to connect the balls as well as before.  It is good to expose Manish Pandey

Shikhar Dhawan still remain quite susceptible at green pitches with swing/bounce. Rahane should play as additional top order batsman in these circumstances as opposed to Yuvraj. Yuvraj's spin is not effective here and he struggles batting against good pace

In the beginning of match pitch was favor for bowler then after 10 over or so started to support batting., then again it changed when next innings began.. but stayed for 20 overs as bowling pitch. This kind of uneven pitches wont be good for good cricket.

Cricinfo should stop this selective censorship, All these overhyped Bd fans are given a free pass to spew their venom against anyone and when someone responds to them directly, Cricinfo censor it under 'moderation'. The editorial policies need to be more consistent then this. You guys have made these boards a joke by allowing comments such as those by: SCANDALBOY and AMMO666. There would have been more such inane comments if Bd hadn't lost the match by the innings break.

Tactic to go with bowling friendly/green pitch is wrong. If your bowling is better than them, why assist their bowlers by giving them such juicy pitch? If your batting unit is weaker than their's, why hurt your own batsmen by making such pitch? Use the home field advantage to help the weakness.

Mashrafe missed the trick by not bowling his spinners more. He shouldn't have finished his quota. Spinners had 23/2 in 5 overs. The should've bowled couple of more overs instead of Mashrafe and Taskin. I know the plan was an all-out pace attack, because it has worked in the past. But plans should be adjustable based on the situation. And I'd expect Mashrafe to know better than anyone else from this team.

India probably score a bit more than par score. Even if india scores 20 runs below par, BD is going to lose. While Al Amin, Mustafiz etc. are good bowlers, Bangladesh has no batsman who can deal with international bowlers at high SR. Shabbir is ok. Soumiya, Sakib and Tamim plays an occasional good innings. BD has to bring Nasir in the team and play 3 quicks. BD should give AlAmin more overs at the top (he can take wickets) and if that means just one over remaining for him at death thats ok. Shakib can bowl one decent over around 17th over. There is no need to bring Mustafiz early on bowlers like AlAmin or Shafiul (even Mortaza relies on new ball). Mustafiz can do his stuff with the old ball.

Its difficult to fathom the selection of Ravindra Jadeja. He is first and foremost a fielder, then a bowler and then a batsmen. Bangaldeshi batsmen are quite good at playing left arm spin and Jadeja's darts are quite repetitive.  Now that Pandya bring's the necessary balance,  a genuine spinner or a pacer could have been selected.

I am really impressed by the bowling of Ashish Nehra. Last time when I saw him he was just an average bowler. But today he was really swinging the new ball. His bowling will give a big advantage to India in the World cup.

India had a big win still gave some hopes to bangla initially with loss of dhawan and kohli. Dhawan bowled was superb, but kohli I don't know what was he trying, sometimes he underestimates bowlers, plays with unwanted aggression. Had he settled little he would have had a chance to rip apart the so called BD pacers

Great performance by Indians, but nothing to take away from Bangladesh bowlers in first spell. It is defensive captaincy by them,which allow to settle Rohit and yuvraj. Yuvraj batted well according to condition but didn't deliver. So better to try Negi also. Lots of big matches are upfront.

BD is going to finish dead last in this cup, thats right...even below UAE ! and BD fans please do not think of clinching ICC WT20 2016, as first BD needs to overcome the NET &amp; IRE juggernauts in qualifiers

@ABY_97 Are you sure India winning from a losing position?? If 1 or 2 wickets falls quickly at the start it doesn't become a losing position.You talk as if you doesnt seemed to be have much knowledge about cricket.It was totally a one sided game.You might have heard in the presentation as well from Harsha Bhogle,he told "although the match was slightly one sided".

Nice win for India. Best feature was the pitch : India batsmen struggled initially but prevailed. Indian pace bowlers made of most of the green surface and closed out the match. Always a pleasure to see good seam/swing/pace bowling from Indians !

@oldtimer01 -Dhoni didn't complain abt the pitch when they played against SL in Pune ..He only said it was more sort of english pitch rather thn indian. Every host nation has the right to prepare track which suits them that's why we called it as home advantage .When India go to aus , eng or Sa... Do they prepare spinning tracks for us.But having said that Bcci i should prepare  green top wicket in indian domestic tournament so that  when team tour overseas  they should cope up with the condition &amp; win. 
@SIJUSK -Rahane can't bat at no 5 as he struggled to score at no 3 in absence of Kohli ..Yuvi is not at his best as of now but he  got limited chances as he came out to bat twice on a difficult track where even dhwan ,raina failed ..Today he was rotating the strike ryt from ball one and when he tried to clear the fence he picked the fielder ..had a decent partnership with rohit ..

Congrats to IN for the win.  BD lost the plot after the drop.  Our bowlers need to be mentally strong because catches will be missed at times but they should not lose focus.  IN scored 25 runs too many.  Scoreboard pressure got to the batsmen.  Hopefully we can recover from this and fight back in the next game.  Go Tigers!

This kind of green top has to be served for test cricket but not for T20 cricket. It backfired on Bangladesh. Srilanka Vs India first t20I might have played on their mind. Rohit played an innings of substance. Let us not read too much into the catch that got dropped of him. That is part of this game, but his innings was a pure class and according to situation. Only a bit worry was Yuvraj Sing not able to clear the rope. Usually on such balls 95 times of 100 he clears the rope. He is suspecting his own ability is what I feel. Not that he played badly but he is just in bit self doubt. Yuvi please shrug off your self doubt, you are a wonderful player to watch mate. We want your old mojo back. Coming to Raina's out it was purely a good ball and foxiness of the bowler. Dhawan got out to a rash shot. When ball is darting that much the shot was not on. As opener he should learn to play to the situation. India bowlers bowled beautiful line and length on this pitch without getting carried away.

falling in their own prey, seems BD concentrated on the oppositions weakness rather than their strength and gave the green top, remember dhoni is quick in correcting his mistakes and once they got to 166, he gave a 6 over spell to both the front line fast bowlers and were unplayable, then used his arrow ash and kayes is clueless the match was over under 10 overs

It was indeed a brave move by Bangladesh.Almost paid off as well.They just need their batsman to apply themselves better and it would make a world of difference.With this win, India will be more confident after winning from being in a losing position.

A good win for India, losing the toss on a green top then losing early wickets to compound matters. Yuvi and Rohit did a good stabilising act before taking the match away.  Experience coming into good play here. Really love the Bangla fans, fiercely patriotic, arent they? Much like our own Eden Gardens crowd, pin drop silence when the opposition plays well. :-)

Catch has cost BD a big time! And the bowlers gave out too much. And the batting is just single thats the best aggresive.

Dude, yes Rohit cashed in on the reprieve, but India would have still won with around 20-25 less runs.  Jadeja, Ashwin really slow down the run flow just like BD spinners, the Indian spinners are now the top bowlers in T20 cricket.

A clinical performance by India especially with the ball. India's concerns currently seem to be more with its batting especially if the pitch is offering assistance to the fast bowlers.The comparative analysis between India and Bangladesh's scores in the 1st half of the Bangladesh innings amply demonstrated that India's superior batting pedigree helped it take the match away from the hosts in the 2nd half of its innings.Fast bowlers from both teams cashed in on a pitch favoring pace bowlers.Both the Pune T20I against SL and the Asia Cup opener has given India's opponents in the upcoming matches in the Asia Cup and World T20 a pointer about India's initial batting struggles on a helpful pitch.

India's concerns currently seem to be more with its batting especially if the pitch is offering assistance to the fast bowlers.The comparative analysis between India and Bangladesh's scores in the 1st half of the Bangladesh innings amply demonstrated that India's superior batting pedigree helped it take the match away from the hosts in the 2nd half of its innings.Fast bowlers from both teams cashed in on a pitch favoring pace bowlers.Both the Pune T20I against SL and the Asia Cup opener has given India's opponents in the upcoming matches in the Asia Cup and World T20 a pointer about India's initial batting struggles on a helpful pitch.

BD are a good team &amp; their curve is going up, they were in the match till over 15. I wish them well for the coming matches. I want to clarify one thing. We Ind fans do not disrespect the BD players. We like them. I am myself a fan of Taskin in particular. Any person playing for his country is trying his best. Results are achieved due to collective basis and no player should be ridiculed, criticism is fine. We Ind fans have no problem with those BD fans who claim their team will win or who have some explanations why their team did not win. Dropped catches, no balls, wrong decisions, 50-50 chances are all valid explanations too. But what irks us Ind fans is when the other fans refuse to say a small Well Played or Player XYZ of India played well or make really mindboggling excuses such as pitch was flat first then became tough later on or when a complete mockery of stats &amp; logic is made. Most BD/SL fans are like this. Many Aus/Eng fans are like this. A few Pak/SA fans are like this too.

@SauravJain You forget that your favorite player Ravindra Jadeja lost us WT20 in 2009 and 2010. Without him, India would have certainly reached the semi-finals in both those occasions. Jadeja is unplayable on rank turners and very good on pitches that turn but he is useless when it doesn't turn. No flight, no dip and no drift. He is a part-timer on those pitches.  Pandya on other hand is very raw but I have repeatedly said on this forum that talent-wise he is the best seam-bowling all-rounder since Manoj Prabhakar.

Only think I didn't like was two wide balls from Jadeja in the last over. Otherwise all 5 bowlers of india would have ended with figures "23 runs in 4 overs".  :p :D

It's not easy to beat this side,as we said before the match.The top 4 has so much momentum goin that at least one is sure of scoring every match.Bd did bowl well in d initial phase,then fizzed out like a deflating balloon.Pakistan wil come even stronger on d bowling,and the team to watch out for on these pitches.

India played brilliantly.  Excellent batting by Rohit and Pandya.  Pandya and Bhumra is the find of 2016.  Pandya is much better than Binny for Indian cricket.  He brings energy into the team.  With his striking ability India at last found a fast-bowling allrounder.  Even today, Bhumra bowled 4-0-23-0.  Bhumrah definitely takes the burden of India's death-bowling problem.  Far better than Mohit and some other fast bowlers of recent days.

@OLDTIMER01 Dhoni never complained about the pitch in Pune. He was asked about the pitch and he replied that the pitch is more British than Indian. Was he wrong? No. We dont see green tops in India. He did not say India lost due to the pitch, he said that they shouldnt have played some of those shots on that wicket. You are twisting his words. Agreed with your argument about Yuvi. He failed yet agian. To DEV MITHRA who says Yuvi played a match winning innings, you have not watched the match. He is good when he gets the freebies like he got from Tye on his pads, but dont expect it in the WC. In WC, every team will be at their best. Till now, people were saying that Yuvi was not scoring because he is not getting opportunities. He got one against SL and he got one now, failed in both. He got what, 12-15 balls something today but was not able to accelerate. He is a No.5 batsman, more often than not he will come in the last 5 overs where he where he will have to start scoring from ball 1.

Bangladesh needed to take few more chances and should've scored 150+. But as usual, they became too defensive. India's finishing is excellent. Great win. BD boy's, there's always tomorrow, just keep the batting a bit more aggressive. Spin might be a better option.

Interestingly today 4 bowlers gave 23 runs 4 overs each and Jadeja given 2 runs more in 4 overs else all 5 bowlers would've given same runs in same no.  of overs. Just missed by 2 runs to become never before bowling figures in a match. Should Jadeja has to pay penalty for giving that 2 runs more :)

@THERIPPER , thank you for your comment. of course wicket plays a role in pace or spin bowling. If it is a flat wicket, not giving any carry and bounce, pace bowlers cannot be successful unless they bowl yorkers. Grass top pitches assists pace bowlers.  Dhawan has weakness for moving, swinging and bouncing pace balls. That everyone knows. Of course he can send the bouncing medium pace ball to the stand, we are talking about his real weakness about quality pace bowling with swing and bounce.

<p>
Any pace bowler or spinner can go for runs on a bad day or on a wicket which doesn't give any assistance to their bowling.

India goes one up here and congratulations to them. However,  I'd request the fans to please be modest. It could have ended either way after good bowling from BD early on. Bangladesh bowlers need to understand a bit about bowling under pressure. There they lost the match. Indian bowlers on the other hand didn't let off the pressure on BD batters. This is something which comes with experience. Pandya is a real gem India found in years. Be it bowling or batting or fielding in the deep, he is outstanding. Good luck to both India and BD for upcoming matches. May the best team win and may keyboard warriors get inner peace to stop spreading hate. :)

There is nothing wrong with Mustafiz, the only player who can play him comfortable is Hardik Panday. But i am sure, a good bowling plan for Panday will work. The noticeable thing is that BD are trying  to make T20 squad by test batsmans which could ruin the players such as Kayes and Mithun.

I think Dhoni said somewhere that he would try to break Yuvi's record of 12 ball 50 if he could get a chance. This could very well be that day. Yuvi need to thank Sakib that he dropped Rohit thus not allowing Dhoni to bat for long!

Well done India ! That was a thrashing by T20 standards. The pitch was pretty decent and I thought India did well to post 166. BD bowled well up until the middle part of India's innings when Rohit and Hardhik ripped them apart. BD fans will be very disappointed with their batsmen. Playing at home, you would want them to perform confidently. Well, things will only get tougher for BD from here. One sided contest overall. Expected a more even contest.

Poor cricket as expected by BD players pls dont get me wrong but it seems BD players still needs further 30/40 years for making them up to Mark, for God sake, guys more than enough chances have been given to you, even they are now playing for Decades but still can not accommodate pressure.....! they lost the match emotionally when India finished batting BD players knew that they are not going to win, look at their faces when they were going back after bowling, i think ICC should step in And take some serious action to enhance the quality of BD cricket otherwise this kind of cricket quality decimates the joy of cricket game, i have no issues with BD players whatsoever so cricket lovers pls ignore my hard world

Thrilling win for India over Bangladesh :-p Rohit made it India's Day with the help of Bangladesh's lapses in fielding. Shikhar misfired as usual. Viraat had bad day. Suresh and Yuvi showed they are not best when facing slow bowlers on helpful track. HP justified his selection by enjoying sometime in middle. MSD did well to not come higher up in the batting order. Chasing 166 was always going to be uphill task for Bangladesh but Nehra &amp; Co. made it more tougher with some help form the track. 4 Indian bowlers conceded 23 runs each in 4 over they bowled. Sir Ravindra Jadeja conceded 25 runs in 4 overs, that 2 extra runs thwarted India from having that amusing record of conceding same number of runs by all bowlers. Time to enjoy the victory.

Bangladesh fans thought beating India was easy based on their wins over New Zealand, West Indies and Zimbabwe. They struggled because of they are not used to slow pitches. Also they thought giving green pitch to India without judging how poor they are on green tracks. I hope their innocent hopes are over. Sri Lanka, Pakistan too have a grate seaming attack and this may change their approaches in coming matches to prepare flat wickets. Good win India and hope Bangladesh fans came back to reality.

Congrats to team India they over powered DB and blown us from the face of earth. But this was expected we were never favorite. Lessons to be learn for Mash 1) Kayes is not a T20 player 2) Sakib is totally out of form give him rest 3) Both mushi and Mahmudullah should bat up the order.

This Indian win is especially satisfying coz several factors were against them. BD served a greentop to counter Indian batsmen, won the toss to exploit that greentop, avoided dew factor, got advantage of D/L in case it rained. Yet, India winning is a really good win.

@oldtimer01, @DEV MITHRA - Neither Rahane nor Yuvraj is needed.  If we are playing on spin pitches then I feel Negi is better. Kedar Jadhav is going to better on any pitches. If pitches suites for fast bowler then even taking Irfan Pathan over Yuvi would be a better gamble. Again, we are talking about t20 game only. Equation changes if we talk ODI or TEST cricket.

Haha people were making their judgements while looking at a green wicket and hoping India will not perform again. Well they did not start well for sure but they picked up well. Excellent knock by rohit and pandya. Well supported by Yuvraj as he had a crutial partnership with Rohit. People who are criticizing yuvraj know nothing about cricket i guess. After looking at Indian innings one thing is clear for sure, you cannot rule them out even after picking 2-3 quick wickets. Superb second half on the greenest wicket. Cheers! Accept the comprehensive win haters.

Why is everyone jumping on Yuvi?He held his nerves really well against Aus.Today he was batting well and his partnership with Rohit stopped the falling of wickets like it happened in Pune.He kept feeding the strike to Rohit and got out trying to clear the ropes.He can be counted on to bowl 4 overs in WC spinning tracks unlike Rohit,Dhawan,Kohli and Rahane.The chance of Yuvi winning match is still a lot higher than Negi.Pandya has been really good.Negi can be tried after WC.

Why is everyone jumping on Yuvi?He held his nerves really well against Aus.Today he was batting well and his partnership with Rohit stopped the falling of wickets like it happened in Pune.He kept feeding the strike to Rohit and got out trying to clear the ropes.He can be counted on to bowl 4 overs in WC spinning tracks unlike Rohit,Dhawan,Kohli and Rahane.The chance of Yuvi winning match is still a lot higher than Negi.Pandya has been really good.Negi can be tried after WC.

<p>
Pandya has been quite impressive looks like a good prospect for the future. Hope dhoni and the team management persists with him and give him the support needed to play to his potential.

@oldtimer01 I brought rahane only because someone asked for his exclusion over yuvraj. What great has he done with his chances? Yuvraj won a t20 for us took maxwell twice and a math winner. Rahane is not a hitter and not good for limited over format, just a waste of time. The moment you guys stopped asking for players who can win for us for rahane i will not mention him. Just look at his games against SL mate! If you saw even a glimpse of brilliance you can back him.

What no bowling speed gun in this match? I suppose when the fastest bowler in either team can hardly touch 135kph it is better to leave the bowling speed gun off &amp; save some electric cost. I'm sure it'll be switched on when Amir,Wahab, Irfan &amp; Sami take the field on Saturday. Ciao

BD made it even clear that Rohit's dropped catch was the real turning point of this game 48 to 83...again sheer luck for IND or else they wouldn't have manage to score over 140.. BD bowlers also lost ryhtm as the pressure got back to them later..in 20 overs IND themselves would fail easily to chase down 166 in this ground had BD scored the same batting first...

@IMONG As long as Mustafiz is bowling quality deliveries, I dont have any complains against him. They can figure him out all they want. Mustafiz just need to keep bowling good deliveries. He may get less wickets, but he will still make an impact. Watch his over again Kohli today. Kohli had a hard time against him. There is no trick here, just good balls.

Bangladesh lost it when they gave india a green top with pace and okay bounce. How can bangla forget that easily how they win all the odi series? India hates when ball doesn't come to the bat, slow and swinging pitches are the real deal. Just because india lost one odd game on pune pitch doesnt mean the will lose everytime. They set their own trap here, also they bowled to much short stuff and defensive field set.

Good bowling by Bangla pacers initially but pitch is way too much in favor of the batsmen. On another note, Mortaza although and off-spinner, has the temperament of a fast bowler. The delivery that got Kohli dipped and stopped on him.

SAURAVJAIN - well spotted about sharma's chances and yuvraj's scratchy innings. Ref yuvraj in particular, I really feel sorry to see him continue when his abilities are clearly on the wane. He was a great batsman and had played some terrific innings earlier but in the last couple of years, he has not been as effective as he was (perhaps because he relied a lot of hand eye co-ordination and with age catching up, the co-ordination is not as good as it used to be). I sincerely hope yuvi retires now and leaves us with happy memories of his old glory instead of departing after playing some scratchy innings.

Recently Bangladeshi selection team made some horrible decisions. They did not try Mithun in Zimbabwe series. They suddenly put him at the beginning of a high pressure chase against India. They did the same with Mosaddek as well. He is a longer version player and was put in a T20 game last month and then was dropped. This is not how you win important games. This is not how you welcome an inexperienced player in the national team.

Well as with Ajanta Mendis, the Mustafiz bubble also seems to have lost the fizz by the second year.  I remember Mendis too had an outstanding 1st year, but 2nd year onwards, they got to him so bad that he hardly found a permanent place in the SL line up after that . Would be really interesting to see how Mustafiz shapes up against Pakistan. Fine talent he is, now let's see can be grow when batsman figure him out and go after him.

Mental strength is needed when a catch is dropped at a crucial time.  I think Taskin let the drop affect his bowling and that permeated through the rest of the bowler.  Good last two overs by Mustafiz and Al-Amin.  Shakib needs to make up for the drop by batting long.  Go Tigers!

@SAURAVJAIN  that was a poor over when Rohit was dropped. the bowler did not deserve a wicket for that.  Anyhow you kindly give up watching T20s as you seem to be taking this format way too seriously.

Be nice guys! India already reached a good total. Let's see how BD bats and how dew plays here too. Should make for an immersive chase. As I mentioned earlier, India won't play the same way as Pune. Rohit's role was to wait out the tough period and have a go later. He succeeded. Mustafizar needs to learn bowling under pressure when hit. Al Amin bowled well but he still needs to go out when Rubel is back. Dhawan needs to be replaced by Rahane. The pitch had 3 phases: Green - easy - slow (towards end of Indian innings). Good luck to both India and BD. Game on!

This is the problem with building up a team of flat pitch bullies. They will most certainly lose matches which are on fast pitches or where bowlers get even the slightest of assistance. Dhoni's captaincy has dropped so low that he almost considers it his right to have flat pitches in India and openly complains if the pitch helps fast bowlers even a bit. And when India loses matches abroad, his standard excuse is that India might have lost on foreign pitches but even the foreign teams lose when playing on Indian pitches. Not the attitude you want to see in the captain.

But if Bangladesh plays sensiblely and one of the top 3 can score above 60,  they can easily chase out 160...  soumya or kayes must stand out today as the pitch seems to be slowing down...

I have written before also Dhawan is very week against moving, swinging, real pace bowling. If wicket suits, opposition has to take advantage his weakness.
</p>
<p>
In the last series, SL captain(Chandimal) lost the ploy and not using real pace bowler Chameera who clicks over 140km/h constantly in the first 4 overs and letting Dhwan settle and breaking record.

Good luck India and Bangaldesh, play a good game and we glad to see the winners after the great fight.

<p>
Make the batsman work hard for each runs, just dont give opportunity for them to make easy run. 
</p>
<p>
For an example, India knows SL batsman Dilshan can never face Ashwin and score runs, so, time to time, they use Ashwin and get rid of Dilshan so cheaply.

Yuvraj can lead down the whole team in wc. Selectors please don't look the past record. Only current performance,experience and form should be taken into consideration. Manish Pandey,RAVINDRA Jadeja, Sarfaraj KHAN,Uthappa,etc are also present who can bat at 5 or 4 better than present Yuvi.
</p>, <p>
<p>
Come on Yuvi! MANISH PANDEY,Jadeja,Sarfaraj KHAN etc are waiting to bat. Take retirement pls. At present Manish Pandey,Ravindra Jadeja,Sarfaraj,Uthappa etc are better batsman than Yuvi.

Bangladesh is paying the price for dropping the catch of Rohit, and could not take the full advantage of early 3 wickets.

Pitches like these expose the reasons why dhoni criticised the pitch in the first Ind-SL T-20. If the pitch is even slightly fast, dhoni uses that as an excuse for defeats and starts demanding flat pitches (and indirectly proves right all those who claim that India can play only on flatbeds). With his mind set being what it is right now, India can hope to win only on flat/ home pitches and losses in most overseas matches are inevitable. I hope selectors drop him at the earliest, in the long term interests and development of the Indian team.

India can  even defend 130 run in this pitch. Anything above 130 is a huge bonus for India. Bangladesh could not take the advantage of early wickets.

And once again we see that if the pitch helps bowlers even slightly or if the bowler is slightly fast, dhawan fails. I am sure dhoni will still persist with dhawan but I hope the selectors intervene and force the right selection.

In this pitch anything above 130-140 is defendable; it all depends on how Bangladesh batting goes.

@ROBIN757.. Not learning from mistakes is what is happening with India. Why so much rush for quick runs. Not that they can't play swing/seam like Australia. They are looking to score 200 runs in every T20. This pitch is best 140 target one like the one in Pune. Simply mindless. Keep wickets, score 5-6  and hit in last 3 overs. Is it that difficult to implement for these experienced players?

India playing for a particular score(180) rather than playing for the pitch.Meanwhile, if India somehow get through the first 10 overs with 3 wickets down, Bangladesh will be in trouble as the green pitch will backfire them.

I knew it the moment ball started swinging that Dhawan will not score. Send Ashwin higher up the order as he is the only batsman in this line-up capable of playing swing. Unfortunately Rahane is not playing.

No doubt his best is yet to come. Because best batting can come in adverse batting conditions, when all batters fail, one will rose above the occasion by defying odds. But, Rohit is a IPL player and he cannot make to Test Team at his own strength, talent and dexterity. All his runs have came on batting paradise. He doesn't have county stint under his belt, to prove his batting ability. So its better he forget to scale height that is reached by players like Viv Richards, Sunny, Sachin, Rahul Sharath Dravid, Punter, Brain Charles Lara and so on.

Yes his sixes and his pull shots are great to watch, but my favorite shots to watch are his fours especially when he hits them all along the ground on the off side. What impresses me about his batting is how he finds the shortest path to meet the ball with the bat in a smooth fluid motion. When he is in full flow towards the end of limited overs innings, the fluency of his shots is awesome. No one can match that intensity of run making in the team currently. I wish Rohit scales new heights, we need it for the sake of Indian cricket. Like Dhoni said, Rohit along with Kohli are the best limited overs batsmen currently for India.

True Rohit struggles against seam and swing (in fact he struggles a lot because of lack of footwork and loose strokeplay outside off-stump) but you cannot deny the beauty of his strokeplay. Once the ball stops moving his strokeplay is matchless in world cricket currently. Usman Khawaja comes a distant second. Rohit is the most beautiful batsman to watch in cricket when he is in full flow right now.

Rohit is the superb clean hitter.i saw so many aggressive batsmen hitting sixes but none has that elegance he possesses!Good luck to you brother don't care about tests, if opportunity comes play like ODI.all your shots in tests are double minded like you are in dilemma. When you see Warner he has no other thoughts whether it's tests or odi or t20.he goes all guns!Anyway just hit sixes and go for Brendon McCollum record since you are the only current Indian batsmen capable of! God bless you and bring amusement to 1.2 billion Indians all around the world.

rohit is a fabulous player, like every player he too has weakness and his weakness is trying to play big shot even to a very good delivery. Many a times rohit gets out in this fashion. If he controls his aggression rohit can play all round the wicket with ease. so it is very easy for rohit to accumulate run because he can play 360 degree region.  if you ak me who has the best timing , i will say its rohit.  when he time the bowl its a six , he is not a mascular man and has no power like virat or dhoni but its his timing that helped him to achieve the record for most sixes i.e 17 sixes in an inning. he will achieve more record for sure.

happy to see rohit grow &amp; mature in terms of his batting . he's become more consistent in recent times. I would like him to succeed in test cricket else it will be gross injustice to his talent. many of his fans like me were disheartened with his inconsistency but I hope the bad days are over. still remember the ian chapel interview where he mentioned that rohit should score a minimum of 10000 test runs given his immense talent. same thing after 2011 WC, when yuvraj was asked whom did he rate as next big thing, he's prompt answer was - rohit sharma. hope he proves them right.

Good - I am happy Rohit has silenced his critics as I am sure he has tired of them just as much as many genuine Indian fans like myself have been. However as can be seen by even some of the comments here, some have 'an agenda' against him as they will still find the tiniest opportunity to criticize him even when he does supremely well. Anyway I am sure there are many more Rohit fans who will always appreciate &amp; support such a talented guy like him &amp; hopefully as he himself says, his best is yet to come!

For the all cricket fans....take this ...from the time he became an opener..or you can say being promoted as a opener ..Rohit has the best average(56.11) among indian Batsman(even over Kohli's  53.06) in ODI's..he has the 4th best average among all batsman(behind Sangakkara,AB De villiers,Ross taylor)..If rohit is flat track bully and so are all the Other Indian batsman...atleast he is being consistent recently and best among his contemporaries..respect that.This point is made regarding ODI's and ODI's only..don't talk about the chances he got before...In a team of Sachin,gambhir,sehwag,kohli,yuvraj and dhoni ,he is always pushed around the batting order and mostly played in foreign conditions than in India in his initial 100 odi's..check that..an average of 33 odd is paltry but not deserved of the hate he receives..Peo

2) Also , ABD made fastest ever hundred in 31 balls, nobody said it was on Flat track and against WI, I am not comparing Rohit with ABD, ABD is class apart .Just saying giving Rohit so much of Hatred which is wrong.

Apart from Indian Bowlers and Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit sharma was the biggest contributor for Aussies in 4-1 series victory against India.

Even though he has the best average as a opener (bar Amla) in ODI's of all time...he is still a flat track bully..Recently he scored 138 against australia where others all put together can't match his score, against a bowling attack of starc,cummins,faulkner on a fast track at MCG..he is still a flat track bully..In england conditions,he gave good starts to team India in Champions trophy and bailed india out in world-cup against bangladesh..still he is flat track bully..the WI-Srilanka-Ind tri series had seen scores of 200 defended regularly..He is the most consistent performer across 3 teams and he is awarded for the same..he failed very rarely after being a regular at the top of Indian batting..Recently against SA while chasing he scored 150 alone on a two-paced track and no other can middle the ball against SA attack...But then he is a flat track bully...Regarding the NZ series..How many openers have average of 30 against nz bowling attack in nz,he is in top 20 across all generation

I would like to made some points here. 1) When in the last Ashes in England, broad took 7 wickets , Nobody criticized him that it was in a swinging condition. He should prove himself on Flat wickets. But when A Batsman make runs , even a fifty in those swinging conditions it is termed as great inning which is the way it should be no doubt.
Have people ever praised a bowler (Indian bowler) working so hard on Dead tracks conceding 70 runs claiming 1 wicket because It was so difficult to bowl. Comparing Rohit with past legends is absolutely rubbish . He himself is saying that. Now comparing him with present player make sense. When he smashed 264, though Flat tracks and short boundaries were there, but these are for all the batsman, and Only he continued to last 50 overs, while Sri lanka had players like Dilshan , Mahela, Mathews and Perera , They were cleaned up for 251. So All the innings he played on "Flat tracks" , All the batsman were given that pitch and he succeeded.

He is old school cross between Inzammam and laxman,lazy elegance they say.Looks quite pleasant to the eye.He ,kohli,rahane are the future of indian cricket across all formats.

not in dream rohit,with all big bats ,small ground,two new ball,just try to be in team for long time,shikhar and you are best in flat tracks and i guess anyone would be best,just see how much teams are scoring and check the pace of their scores like guptil,butler,dekock,mccullum, who play selfless cricket...what made sachin dada viru hayden gilli the best openers is the fact that in that era no one played like them, still miles to go rohit...

@CHITTI_CRICKET  Because he disappointed even his supporters. He still good bet in flat wicket and weak bowlers. He got lucky aussies did not have any fast bowlers this time. That clouds his judgement. May be he is in cloud 9 because people praised him on his performance in australia. I am not angry at rohit sharma as person. I am angry at his supportes who says he has more time when he bats than others. But that is not exactly true. he do not have time against good fast bowlers. He really do not move that much in crease. That may allow people to think he has more to time to react. Its an illusion. He plays late. He is a touch player. He can really transform himself if he do not meet his kryptonite bowler in this year. EVery one will become bunny of certain bowlers.I really think he will fail badly against nz adam milne fast ball.

As an aside, no one can accuse rohit and dhawan of having any false sense of modesty. This is quite symptomatic of an era where abuse is mistaken for aggression and arrogance confused with confidence. It is quite funny to see the likes of dhawan fail for 10-12 innings and then make one decent score on a flat pitch/ against weak attacks; and then immediately start walking around with a swagger (reminiscent of vivian richards) as if he is a world beater.

Gangly and tendulkar are class apart from this duo. They played against wasim, waqar,akthar, vaas, Murali, saqlain, Donald, Pollock, McGrath, warne, Lee etc. They played without any field restrictions. When they played we had an emotional attachment with them. Please don't compare this duo with them.

My 15 for world T20 - the first XI is Shikar Dhawan, Rohit, Kohli, Raina, Yuvraj, Dhoni, Hardik, Jadeja, Ashwin, Bumrah, Nehra, + 4 players - Manish Pandey, Pawan Negi, Sran, B Kumar. Harbhajan &amp; Rahane narrowly misses out. also missing out is axar patel. the first XI has a good batting strength + 4 bowlers + Hardik, raina and yuvraj can turn in as bowlers to complete the quota of 5th bowler. A lot will depend on our batting, as the bowling still looks thin.

What a ridiculous comparison. Defies logic. Rhoit has just now started doing well after years of persistence with him. And dhawan has been plain lucky that dhonis support has led to his being given far more chances than he deserves. One good innings every 10 odd matches does not justify his blocking a place for so many years. Not to forget his utterly selfish and slow innings in the 3rd ODI which led to india losing the match. Let us not get carried away after a few runs being scored on flatbeds against weak attacks and overestimate their abilities or pamper to overinflated egoes. We need to maintain our perspective and objectivity while comparing batsmen, especially across generations.

As usual politically calculated statement from Rohit Sharma. Dhawan is not as good to stay in indian team for long time. Others should get chance to open as well.  There is nothing players can do when batting at number 4 or 5 and coming at over 45 in odi or at over 16 in t20. India should have rotation policy for openers and single failure should allow others players to get chance to play in upper order. We may discover better than Rohit and Dhawan with rotation policy. Imagine if Raina gets chance as opener and gets success, Australian odi series would not be 4-1, where bowling was poor of both sides and just Australian batting was little better than India. Those days of fixed position in batting orders are gone with that much bench strength and dynamic nature of the game.

Just imagine waqar younis banana missile at Rohit sharma toe. he would not even score single run. Sometime stats are skewed.  At present there is no single bowler including steyn that is equal waqar younis or akram. He won't even have time. All his extra time is against slow bowlers. Sometime people overhype batsman like rohit sharama. it is really sad.

great to see some confidence in him after all this time. he is in masterful touch. if he can continue like this the world t20, India's batting would be pretty stable. would love to see this form and confidence transition into the whites as well. but we might have to wait a bit longer on that I suppose. you can't drop anyone in the top 5 in tests for this guy right now. But he is a sure fit if there are 6 batsmen playing overseas especially :). On another note , Australian tracks are extremely batting friendly in the last couple of years, what's up with that. there needs to be something in it for the bowlers for the game to be enjoyable really

Sometimes people get into illusion when they see a flat track and garbage bowlers. Rohit sharma in that state. It is all luck. Because aussies bowlers pattinson starc cummins all injured at right time. Rohit sharma pretty good in flat pitches where he can hit through line. I never believer in aesthetic that much. I do really really think rohit can shine under kohli than dhoni. He needs right environment. Kohli can provide that. But rohit sharma is 10% of kohli interms of skill or mental strength. My advice to rohit is stop speaking about your achievement and let others speak about you. That is only way you can achieve greatness. India can win this t20 worldcup easily if everything goes well.

Well as an Indian I would love to see Rohit doing better than this though I think scoring 441 runs in a 5 match series at an average of 110 is really very special. This has already set the benchmark for other batsmen. He played some flawless cricket in Australia. Loved every bit of it. The other thing he said about MS is really something big and everyone need to understand that. He put it very right that it takes much more effort to hit the soft ball in death overs with new ODI rules than batting in powerplay or middle overs. It is always difficult for batsmen at number 5,6 and 7 to hit each and every ball but excuses put aside as they are aware of that and do practice accordingly and that's the reason MS and Raina are successful at these positions. But we all need to understand that they are also human beings and can fail to capitalize the equation sometimes.So Instead of bashing them we need to trust and support them. And I would totally agree with Sharma about MS. He is special.

We all see his excellence in the One Day arena. He is one of the very best. However some facts need to be brought to light about the longer form. Rohit has ONLY played ~15 tests in a 8 year span. That in itself is a grave injustice. The guy just hasn't got a fair chance in tests. Give him 10 tests in a row and see what he can do. He is VERY special.

That in itself is a grave injustice. The guy just hasn't got a fair chance in tests. Give him 10 tests in a row and see what he can do. He is VERY special.

Most of the comments that are coming out of sheer dislike to this player are just unwanted. Yes he did have failures and yes they are more failures, But when he is on song he is the best batsman to watch. Truly speaking at one point even I used to think he is given lot too many chances. What he told on this interview are from a personality of very humble nature but not from an arrogant natured person. Why people are getting so much angry on him/Dhawan comparing to Sachin/Ganguly and getting motivated by that to perform well has to anger anybody. We did compare our own great Sachin to Richards, Don Bradman and previous cricketing heroes. Did that generate any anger from those countries? en emphatic no other than some sinister Sachin haters. Rohit haters can think of themselves now. More than him more commentators here look to me arrogant and sinister in their comments.

It's doesn't matter how much you scored 441 is just a number what matters is on such placid flat wickets where there was no movement you couldn't push the accelerators when needed and as a result we lost it by 1-4.  Dhoni defame bowlers for bowling bad lines but on such tracks even a glen macgrath would have leaked runs can he please explain the role of middle order if he entitled Rohit sharma to play more than 150 balls Dhoni is trying to hide himself because his current form is wayward. When ever sachin and saurav or a sehwag used to play they get their 100 in less than 30 overs and rest of guys in middle order then get time to settle down. We are not getting a start sehwag or sachin used to provide Rohit take too much time to get in &amp; wastes lots of delivery nearing landmark With the change in odi rules in which a bowling side have a luxury to use 5 fielder protecting boundaries finisher role becomes difficult a finisher should come at 35th over but Rohit will 50 over wdf.

@cricketchat u see kohli keep giving chances to dhawan in tests despite constant failure in sa series despite few innings ago rahul made a hundred. bro stop bashing dhoni for everything he is the one who persisted with kohli not sharma in aus tout 2011 test series and result is known he debuted kohli in age of 19 but nobody gives credit to him but guys like u keep bashing him without reason .similarly ashwin was groomed  rohit got debut in last year of dhoni captaincy in tests but everybody bashed dhoni for selecting rohit also.today's all test players how u say prominent is groomed by msd.virat even dropped pujara to accommodate rohit so is dhoni forced him to do so if so why he didn't do it in his captaincy. bro dhoni dropped jadeja from test squad but kohli picked him is dhoni forced kohli to pick jadeja. I have real feel for jadeja even singlehandedly won us WC ( meanwhile he won ct 2013 singlehandedly especially final with both bat and bowl and lords test) he is often crictized as he is dhonis choice.

I have seen a few comments stating that Rohit got many chances and that he is not consistent. Well, i would like to disagree a little here. Yes he got chances, but he got them because he was deserving and had potential, and now that potential is for everyone's display and no one can deny that. More importantly he took the chances that were given to him unlike many others. Also, if you look at the last 3-4 years he has been one of the most consistent batsmen in limited overs cricket. last 3 years alone his average is around 70+ which brings his overall avg around to 43 which is a healthy avg to have and he would further improve on it no doubt. in test though, i agree he needs to stabilize more. He has been in &amp; out of the team to accommodate bowlers and the 6-5 combination etc. But yes as someone here suggested, opening in that format might also work wonders for him as it would suit his style of absorbing the pressure earlier on and then later playing the strokes. Dhawan needs to go.

Not so sure about the partnership lasting long. Dhawan has these period of short highs and long lows.  He survived as long as he did because Dhoni was the captain. I am not so sure Kohli would be as forgiving if he only makes a useful contribution once every 8-10 innings like he in the past 2 years or so.

@ Anand_s, comparisons aren't just fair. As much as you compare the fast bowlers that Sachin &amp; Saurav faced as opposed to what Rohit &amp; Shikar faces today, the same argument holds good when you compare Sachin against batsmen of the previous era that had to face a lot more fearsome Marshall, Holding, Roberts, Garner, Ambrose, Lille, Thompson, Pascoe etc. It is not longer an apple to apple comparison. With the arrival of T20 and having more modern cricket bats, batsmen approach the game very differently. There is constant change in rules that allow batters to score a lot more freely. We have to be happy with the ones that give us the entertainment when we are in front of our TV sets !

@hedyat raza khanM starc is not a great bowler any way last visit India .Indian treated him as spinner see the highlight of chennai test and commentary of gavaskar .manages  just 3 wkt in 3 games avg 60 and again in aus 2014-15 India tour virat hit him so hard that he was evenualy out of test squad during that series.he has good WC so as boult shami umesh and wahab but it instead of these 4 who performed well in alien conditions taken nearly similar wickets starc get the hype. he is a decent bowler not in class of steyn.till WC he has Johnson who leads the attack now he has to build pressure by his own let's see how he cope with.

Wow, taken a back by Rohit's comment.  You were given a long long long rope to perform. I doubt whether anybody got this long a rope. You are performing now. Thanks. Reg Dhawan, another long rope guy. You both can not survive good bowling more than 5-6 overs. As far as it is a flat track, you guys do well. Please dont compare to sachin, sourav. They can play good bowling too.

I have enjoyed watching Rohit bat many times , I have seen him get run out for taking risky single runs. Otherwise , his batting skills are excellent and his strokes are joy to watch.  Wish you and the team best for the T20 World Cup in March

However good the Sachin Sourav combination was, they still belong to an era gone by.Cricket is seeing continuous changes in terms of rules, playing strategies and abilities, influence of T20 included.Rather than trying to emulate the past, adapting to surfaces, bowling styles and match requirements should be focussed upon.Winning should always be the only goal.Everything else should be byproduct.

Anyone comparing Rohit/Dhawan with Saurav/Sachin must be shot dead. This pair could not survive 10 overs against Steyn and Morkel. They have not faced the likes of Pollock/Donald/Bret Lee/Gillespei/McGrath/Wasim Akram. Have no runs to show against Anderson and Broad !!!  Saurav and Sachin would put on 100+ stands in 12 to 13 overs in pre T20 era against quality bowling in tracks that are not feather beds.
</p>
<p>
Of course it may be reasonable to say that they are the best opening pair currently available for India.

Good words by Rohit Sharma. Runs are runs in international cricket wherever you play. Those saying flat decks and weak bowling should check their stats first. As far as comparison to Sachin-Ganguly goes, there is a lot to cover for Shikhar and Rohit. Rohit as of now is a champion in white ball cricket and a disappointment in Tests to say the least.

@ALEXK400 .  The fact that he and Sachin were responsible for Indian winning 2007 coommon wealth games in Aus is not something good to you!! Rohit showed remarkable patience in taking India to last run. Sachin complimented him as next Indian batting talent. He proved he is.
Cant believe that he was only 20 years then. how fast life goes on!!.  We gave him too many chances but he is still better than any other new comer who have taken chances, other than Kohli. No new comer succeeded as Rohit and Kohli.
Dhawan has a long way to go. He is easily caught in covers.  Got to improve his skill like Kohli to stay in game without getting out by being caught so easily. Has to hit ball to ground for boundaries.
Regarding facing swing,they have to learn a lot. but are there any players in india who can replace them?

The Sachin-Ganguly pair had tremendous record in all types of pitches.. Whereas Rohit/Dhawan have performed only on flat tracks and weaker bowlers.. Alas India plays 90% of their ODI matches only on type of pitches and bowlers... So its no wonder these guys have a good record.. I have never seen Dhawan play a decent knock in pitches which offered some assistance to bowlers.. Rohit has played some good knocks against tough opponents but has never been consistent in that regard.. So please do not come up with such mindless comparisons..

No doubt , Rohit has the talent and his batting is pleasing to the eye . But he lacks consistency and has so far shown that his game is only suited to limited overs cricket. His focus should be to do better in Test cricket for him to win admirers . The selectors have given such a long rope to Rohit that he has to justify the faith shown by the selectors. It will be good if he performs in all forms of cricket . He has a long long way to go to match the Fab 4 and Viru .

Rohit Sharma is an immensely talented batsman, no doubt on that. It was he who has not done good justice to his talent by wasting too many good starts he had in all formats of Cricket and made himself a target of criticism. He has no one other than himself to blame, So much same we can say on S.Dhawan as well, a talented but not proven yet.
1.  If there are comparisons drawn and that motivates these guys to perform better for India and cricket no one should have any problem on that and undue criticism on that is unwanted. 
2. As he himself said in any walk of life if we think we have done our best at any given point of time then there we stop, that shows his humble attitude to his profession and desires no criticism on that
3. What he achieved in Australia over last few months is no mean achievement, we cannot say he did not play against Mc,Grath and Co, that is shear stupidity since no one is for ever in his/her walk of life.
This interview is good retrospection into him. Kudos.

As much as I have opposed his selection, I must admit he's done a fair bit in ODI/T20 cricket. I still don't think he deserves a place in the Test side. He's far too loose with his technique to be successful outside the sub-continent. As for people who've fallen flat for some 'apparent' beauty in his batting, I prefer performance over aesthetics. So half a Steve Smith over a Rohit Sharma is a no-brainer.

I am not sure who comes up with these grand statements and comparisons but the guy needs a strong doe of reality. Sachin and Ganguly were complete ODI batsmen and together they formed one of the top opening pair of their times, successful against a variety of attacks on a range of pitches. In comparison, these two resemble the Mumbai skyline (huge partnerships interspersed with a long range of low ones) and take way too long to get started. Both are extremely vulnerable against a moving ball (Dhawan even seems suspect against the offies) and seem to belong to an era gone by during the first 15 overs. Please stop trivializing some of the best we have had for marketing's sake!

The amount of time and effort, that IND have invested in Rohit is enormous and finally, he has arrived to the scene coming a long way. But, truly it is remarkable that a make-shift opener performs great in this specialist role, though in ODIs, as many people ridiculed him as NOHIT sharma (very cruel this) and other mumbaikar stories. I believe, he had not opened for his team in domestic circuit, lovely Irony and me too thought 'Opening' is not his forte!! Kudos to him and wish him to work more and polish his skills to get a solid place in TEST team too.. Alas, it is whose fault, if the potential is left as is, as potential forever !!!

Has Rohit Sharma finally lived up to the expectations and hype around his ability? In ODI cricket you have to feel that he has. He has now become consistent and is scoring hundreds, BIG hundreds for fun. His average is well into the 40s now so you have to feel he has turned a corner, a very important one! Still surprises me that fans call for him to play lower down the order! He isn't going to score 150+ when coming in at 4 or 5 so it makes no sense. He is an opener now so let him stay there. 
</p>

Still not 100% sure on Dhawan. Yes he has flashes of brilliance but he is also very unpredictable, however being a left-hander I think he has the benefit of keeping his place. He is also a very good fielder.

If these 2 can come close to the Sachin-Sourav record, India will be the best ODI team in the world for a while!

Has Rohit Sharma finally lived up to the expectations and hype around his ability? In ODI cricket you have to feel that he has. He has now become consistent and is scoring hundreds, BIG hundreds for fun. His average is well into the 40s now so you have to feel he has turned a corner, a very important one! Still surprises me that fans call for him to play lower down the order! He isn't going to score 150+ when coming in at 4 or 5 so it makes no sense. He is an opener now so let him stay there.

@AMMO666: It is not necessary to become a pretty good side when you are already the best side in the whole world. If you do not believe me please look up the ICC ranking table. It is now 1-2-1. Very soon it will become 1-1-1.

"Just this two T20 wins in friendly pitches " ~ sour grapes that's all. In 2013 when Johnson took England apart the pitches were fine. When the weakest away team in the world makes bigs scores on these pitches then these pitches are blamed!

Excellent performance by India. This is probably the team they should have had in the ODI's. Ishant Sharma, Yadav, Kumar aren't putting their best, India needs attacking bowlers, Bumrah looks good. Bumrah and Raina's inclusion in ODI's might have lead to a different result in ODI's. India's form in thisT20 series truly represents the class they have on their squad, just be more consistent. Well played!

Just this two T20 wins in friendly pitches will never make IND a pretty good side...T20 is a funny game, even weaker teams wins somehow by either batting well or bowling well in an innings.... seems like this modified AUS'n T20 team is yet to be well set..IND took good advantage of that winning the series....

@izzidole- correction: the last india-aus test series was NOT a whitewash. It was a 2-0 finish. Thinking of it, the test series in india was a whitewash (in favor of india, of course). Dont let your hate come in the way of facts. Cricinfo pls publish.

Congrats Indian team for  winning a bilateral series outside of Subcontinent and West Indies after a long time .Throughout this Australian tour there have been some fans posting here claiming to be Australian fans but when in reality they aren't and are just bandwagoning so they could bash Indian team whenever they have lost (sadly quite often) we all know who they are and what nationalities they actually represent. Real Australian fans will either stay away from comment section or be gracious and sporting enough to congratulate India.Don't say Australians don't care about T20 because then how do you explain the super success of BBL ?? By constantly repeating that Australian bowling attack is 2nd or 22nd string you are disrespecting your own cricketers and even conceding the fact that beyond Hazelwood,Starc and Pattinson Australian bowling stocks are threadbare .But as i said real Australian fan will never do that

Impact bowlers like Mitchell Starc and Mictchell Johnson (both left arm - ideal against right handed batsmen) helped Australia win the limited over world cup on home soil. Without them, Australia looses that aura of invincibility and can be easily overcome by a determined opposition. Lyon is hardly a T20 spinner. They must find at least two good spinners who can bat a bit for the T20 Tournament in India or forget about going beyond Semi's in those conditions.

The results in the series will hardly be important for both the sides, other than say help in building momentum. I am not sure Australia are really interested in the World T20, since all their build involves tests and ODIs. But do remember there  is hell of talent in the Australian side, there will be spin (not as exaggerated as nagpur, but conventional spin) and Australia should promote Lyon, Boyce for the World T20. They really need Warner big time, because Smith hasn't really shown that playing swing or spin is his stronger suit. I guess Khwaja also becomes crucial then.

After twelve consecutive losses including a test series whitewash and the limited overs series in 2014/2015  tour and losing the 2016 ODI series 4-1 India has finally won a cricket series in Australia. Thanks to the injury prone aussie cricket team minus their star pacemen Starc and Cummins forcing the selectors to rest their stars Pattinson and Hazlewood for the test series against New Zealand. Unless the ACB finds a quick solution to fix the never ending injury problems of our pacemen the Australian cricket team will have to suffer the consequences. During the last six months alone Harris was forced to retire due to injury concerns followed by  Johnson this summer. Surely the ACB could spend to employ an expert physio from USA to put a stop to this menace which has been plaguing the Australian cricket team for many years. For instance Cummins who made his test debut with  a match winning performance against S. Africa in 2011 has hardly played ever since  due to nagging injury concern

I agree about aussie commentrators being baised. I remember watching an INd-Aus ODI in he 1990's with gavaskar and chapel in the commentary box. Venkatesh Prasad was hit for a 4 by the aussie batsman and Prasad responded with a bouncer which went over the batsmans head. Chappel immediately said this was frustration and after being hit for a 4, Prasad in his frustration sent a bouncer which went harmlessly over the batsmans head. Gavaskars rejoinder was classic "I don't get you, I just don't get you. Mcgrath did the same when india was batting and you called it aggression and when Prasad does it, it is frustration. I just don't get it". Chappel was left speechless and could only reply that he did not get gavaskar all the time, to which gavaskar (his point being made), laughed and said "that makes it even. you don't get me and I don't get you". I wish we had indian commentrators today who could come up with such witty repartees to counter the aussie commentrators.

Zona dear...India is struggling in foreign conditions, so other teams also...Australia has not won any test match in India since from 2004..&amp; in last 30 years they won only one series here in India...England won test series in India in 2012 after 35 years...the best visiting team SA lost series by 3-0...NZ is yet to win a test series here...going by your population logic, China should have been the best Cricketing country in the world...we have produced some great fast bowling talents in past like Kapil Dev, Zaheer, Srinath who all touched 140+...India's top order is in great form...nearly top three batsmen scored 2 centuries each in this tour (im not remembering any other team has repeated this)...recently SA toured Aus, but lost ODI series by 4-1, our team has not performed that bad in the series, all matches went to tight finish, failed to capitalize few key moments...certainly India looking very strong contender for T20 WC...semi finalists will be SA, WI, India &amp; Pak

@ABC3 - a lot of people say dhoni doesn't nurture talent because he does not give a chance to most newcomers. Under him, chances have been given to only certain favoured players, for years altogether, regardless of performance. Its almost like these players are persisted with until they do well in one or two matches, whereafter dhoni will immediately praise them in the post match conferences and claim that they were impact players and have reposed the confidence placed in them. A whole lot of players haven't been given even a fraction of these chances. If you want a captain who really nurtured talent, look no further than ganguly. I have my grouses about ganguly but as a captain who groomed and nurtured talent, he was one of the best. After dhoni at the helm for so many years, forget bench strength, we don't even have promising youngsters waiting to take over from seniors. And then dhoni has the gall to complain about domestic cricket not producing good players.

I find it hard to believe that after the farcical dismissal of Steve Smith the other day, whilst "wired up" and being harassed by the bumbling channel nine commentary team, that they would try it again, but I was wrong. This time they chose to make the captain Aaron Finch "live" and at one stage two of them were at him at once, peppering him with questions, while he was trying to give instructions  to his fielders. This may not be the World Cup yet, but these are international matches, with players fighting for their places in the side and the team trying to gel as a cohesive unit. Surely they deserve better than being beset by these people, who obviously have no idea how and when (or perhaps IF) these "interviews" should be conducted.

I hope for India's sake they win the World T20 cup because for their fan sakes they already believe they have won it and we know what happens when things do not go to plan. Semi final WC ODI blame placed on Players partners, Semi final world cup 1996 Indian Fans setting fire to the Stadium because the were losing. A lot of you Indian fans need to realise that any team can have a good or bad day despite the quality of players they may field. India has a very good team but so do some other countries.

Aussie commentators have got to be the most biased of any country. Watching sky sports in the UK, I love how they squirm at any prospect of Aussies losing. When India scored above 180 both times, they kept on saying how Aussies are going to win when they have never ever chased &gt;160 in aus!  Even this ridiculous on screen thing called winviz predicted 57% chance of an Aussie win at the interval in the 2nd T20 - boy there must be some really bad statisticians down under and a public that loves delusions.  Their team shoes more dignity while losing than their comms.  Unpleasant blokes.

To all those talking about this being z string Aussie team, I have only one question - Who told you to field n string team? We didn't asked you to field this team...it's your choice. 
And this Cummins/Pattinson injury execuse is really getting boring now. These two guys are ever injured, and still Aussie fans bring their name as an execuse everytime they lose?! LOL
And to be fair, the kind of thrashing all Aussie bowlers have got from the hands of Indian top order, I can't see Start/Cummins/Patto would have made much difference. Latest example being Shaun Tait taken to the cleaners.
So please, Aussie fans, take this loss with a pinch of salt and come with better exec....errrr...preparation.

Jadeja must bat up at Number 5 in ODIs and T20s as he is far better batsman than Gurkeerat,Robin Singh,Chris Harris,Pathans,Kaif,Dinesh Mongia,Hemang Badani,Rajjak,etc. Most of these players played as a batsman and when Jadeja is better batsman than all of them,why he is never given chance to bat at 4 or 5 and add crucial 60-70 runs with good strike rate.

"Travis Head, Cameron Boyce, Shaun Tait and Kane Richardson were dropped in the biggest upheaval to an Australian side since another T20 series, against West Indies in early 2013. "
They all deserved to be axed. Unfortunately their replacements were no better. Boland is clearly out of his depth at international level. Lyon is not a T20 player. There are better options than Wade &amp; Watson is yesterdays man. Maxwell remains, imho, the most overrated player in Australia. The Australian selectors must take most of the blame for the series loss.

It took hardly 384 milliseconds for Jadeja to grab that catch. One of the greatest catch of history. Jadeja should be man of the match in both matches for his outstanding bowling,and electric fielding in both matches. In first match also he caught a stunner. Jadeja is the only bowler in ODIs and T20s whom Aussies has shown enormous respect.

It is amusing to find comments from students of captaincy against the best ever professor of captaincy in history of world cricket in all its forms- MSD. Reality is different though. IND with a new look team won CT 2013, reached final of T20WC 2014 &amp; won bilateral series in ENG in 2014 after 24 years &amp; reached SF of CWC 2015. If IND's top 4 with only 5 (50+) scores in 6 key matches of CWC2015 had performed better another CWC would have been in bag. IND during last 3 yrs have won 12 tests with top 2 match batting contributions from Pujara (6), Vijay(5), Rohit (4),Rahane(3),Dhawan(2),Kohli(2). The top 2 match bowling performances in test wins have been from Ashwin(11),Jadeja(8),Ishant(2),Shami(1), Bhuvi(1). IND recently missed opportunities of test series wins in SA/NZ/ENG/AUS due to batting &amp; fielding errors. IND has excellent batting &amp; bowling combinations but need more experienced batting/bowling/fielding/fitness coaches &amp; work load management for fast bowlers for greater consistency.

Jadeja's catch was pretty cool. It's probably more like Jedi-ja. He must have Jedi reflexes to catch balls like that.

ABC3. We have many more players missing from both the ODI's and the T20's you failed to mention. 1 being arguably the best white ball bowler in the world in Starc. It is typical of Indian supporters to conveniently leave things out to support their arguments. Like Australia being whitewashed in tests by India in India  but forgetting the same has happened to India in Australia.

@Zona Dude, we agree we haven't produced a pace bowler like Australia. We have compensated for that by pitching in a few good batsmen over the years. 30 years, 16% world's population is all garbage - why then do only people from the US &amp; Caribbean hold all the sprint records and the ones from Africa, the long-distance records? It's a perspective thing and we are doing fine as a nation. How many chess players have Australia produced with an Elo of above 2700? None. 
Whatever, so what's the point? Beating Australia in a series in Australia is difficult - so why don't you give credit where it is due? What if it was a Aus C or Aus B bowling attack - didn't Australia play to win? Learn to take losing in your stride and move on! Cheers.

That population card had to come as it is SL's last saving grace. Now lets compare, AUS which has almost equal population as SL has 5 WC, 2 CT compared to SL's tally of 2 (I don't believe in joint winners crap, so no CT). WI too has less population, infact it's not even a country but a group of small islands but still has 2 WC, 1 T20 and 1 CT. Finally, the team SL played recently; NZ has only about 5 million population but look how they won. Any other logic you wanna present?

OLDTIMER01 and  other Dhoni bashers. Why do you always say he didn't nurture any players. He is by far the only Indian captain in history who persists with players and gives them the sense of security inspite of their early failures. Gives the players a long run if he sees talent and is not worried about a few failures. In the history of Indian cricket 80's, 90's many new players were discarded by former captains and selectors after a game or two never to be seen again. If not for him players like Rohit and Jadeja would have been long gone. The administration and selectors in last few years also need to be commended also as they have shown consistency in selection and gave players enough room to mature unlike the past in 90's. If selection was left to the fickle Indian fans then we would see a new 11 after every match/series. 90% of Indian fans lack cricket knowledge and just talk rubbish and most are too biased to their own state/caste players and can't see beyond them.

SunnyD How much whinging did you expect? Unfortunately those people everywhere but not quite the thousand wingers after India lost each of the first four one day games. India were too good however I still have high hope we can win the world cup once a team is settled on. The unfortunate thing for Australia is we dont have many bowlers that can add to the current batch. I doubt Pattinson will play, Coulter-Nile and Starc wont be back and Hazlewood has played very little cricket in this form and asking a lot for him to adjust in a world cup. No doubt India have a very good side though.

@NS1000 - I agree with you. The latest wins were the result of spinners finally coming into play and all batsmen firing. Dhoni's captaincy was hardly a factor (it never has been in my opinion; it is his batting which has won matches). Leave alone brilliant captaincy, dhoni has not even nurtured talent and groomed young players. It is high time dhoni is removed as the captain (I don't believe he is selfless enough to step down on his own).

Tons of comments about 3rd, 4th 5th, 6th string Aus players. Bottom line 2-0 India and that is all that counts. Going by same logic Aus beat India B team in ODIs. Their first choice bowlers Shami and Mohit were injured and the late middle order were filled with rookies like Gurkeerat/Pandey/Rishi with first choice player Raina missing. Would you Aus fans agree that they beat India B team in ODI with many debutants. Now coming back to AUS team, one hit wonder boy Cummins is always injured. Have Pattinson and Cummins every played and lasted a full series without breaking down midway through series. One way it's a nice excuse for you guys that you can always bring up above two perennially injured players when ever you lose a match to opponents in futures games. "Oh we are missing Cummins/Pattinson. This is Aus B team" should be your catch phrase to bring up in this message board for every lost game in future against any opponent. LOL.

I came straight to the comments section to see excuses from Australian fans, and found more whining than expected like third string to sixth string team, this guy didn't play, that guy didn't play etc.
I think India's priorities are in right order, WCT20 is coming up, so T20 should matter more than other formats.
Relax Australian fans (zona etc). Acceptance is the first step for peace in your mind.

@ THERIPPER - Unforunately, I think you missed the point of my post entirely. Please stop quoting attendance as representative of Aus's sentiment toward T20 cricket. Think about it. T20 is on at 7PM when people have finished work and can easily attend. Most of the people that attend the T20s likely don't have all day to spend at the cricket. Hence BBL would get consistently more sizeable crowds. As I said before, it's easy to attend T20 and is cricket in a conveniently digestable format. It does NOT mean we care about the results. It's meaningless entertainment. If you want to quote crowd sizes, the ODI series crowd attendance significantly increased on the weekend and Friday night matches. Why? Because people were NOT working. Finally, regarding India being lacklustre - what else do you call bowling so inept (by both sides) that they cannot contain totals of 300+ 4 times in a series. I'd rather watch a tight and tense run chase of 220 than watch batsmen slog down 330+ anyday.

@zona - do you remember a bowler named ajit agarkar. He wasn't high profile or flamboyant, which is why he did not remain in public memory for long; however he consistently bowled at speeds of 145 and regularly touched 150. He was a good bowler and played an important part in some of Indias memorable wins of that era. While he was a good bowler an a reasonably good batsman, his issue was consistently which is why he did not realise his potential and contribute to the indian team as much as he could. Another point is the role of captaincy in nurturing players. Ganguly, under whom agarkar played, was excellent at managing people and grooming talent. Ganguly realised that though low profile, agarkar could be an effective bowler and backed agarkar. In recent times, how many bowlers has dhoni nurtured like this? And then after not managing the talent pipeline, dhoni complains about domestic cricket not producing good players.

If Jadeja's catch off Watson wasn't one of the best in the past decade, please advise of another one that comes even close.  The ball came back at him at about half a second.   Catches on the boundary usually give the fielders a lot more time to react.

On a different topic, why doesn't ICC use baseball gloves instead of the useless crap they have done for centuries?  The WK would only have to wear one glove and it is so much much easier to grab the balls in all varying directions so easily.  Please respond if anyone else has had similar thoughts.  The current WK gloves seem so useless compared to the baseball gloves which only require one hand and more flexibility on both sides of the body.

I'm a bit confused so help me out fellow cricinfo gurus.   Dhoni lost the ODI in Australia due to his batting skills in a couple of ODIs and hardly had a hand to play in the T20 win (thanks to Virat, Sharma, Dhawan - still a work in progress IMO, Bhumrah, Nehra and Jadeja - what an incredible catch and a great fielder).   Why is Dhoni stil leading this Indian team in the shorter formats?   Is it because he is likelable as a losing captain during post match interviews and his past?  If India is to succeed in the shorter format, Kohli as ODI captain and Rohit as T20 captain is the way forward.   How sad that we Indians now think the world of Dhoni (who just lost 4-1) in ODI and won the T20 in which he hardly had a part to play.  No need to be malicious and brainless in how you respond.  I still believe that India needs Dhoni out of the shorter formats for the good of the team in the long run.

'Ambi' &amp; F1
</p>
<p>
'Ambi' is the shortened form of 'Ambassador' car (Indian version of the 1956 Morris Model from UK). An Ambi went to Oz for a 1 to 1 racing with an F1 Australian car, on Oz tracks. Oz boss for races took a look at it. Wasn't impressed. The Ambi 'looked', held together using chewing gum and scotch tape. 
</p>
<p>
A newer Indian model had lost only recently 4 of 5 races earlier, Oz car winning, rather easily. Why this, he muzed.
</p>
<p>
This  retro one Ambi is fit enough to cross dirt tracks, many thought.  But, those who brought it to Oz are friends. They should not be perfunctorily brushed aside. So, agreed for the race. Took some handicaps, on their own. Changed a couple of original tires to spare ones. 
</p>
<p>
Somehow, Ambi won the 1st race!

"Anyway, we don't care these silly short races", said the boss. And, felt so. For the 2nd race, all 4 wheels of the Oz car were fitted with spare tires, the originals kept aside wrapped in wool for better races in NZ.

'Ambi' &amp; F1
</p>, <p>
'Ambi' is the shortened form of 'Ambassador' car (Indian version of the 1956 Morris Model from UK). An Ambi went to Oz for a 1 to 1 racing with an F1 Australian car, on Oz tracks. Oz boss for races took a look at it. Wasn't impressed. The Ambi 'looked', held together using chewing gum and scotch tape. 
</p>, <p>
A newer Indian model had lost only recently 4 of 5 races earlier, Oz car winning, rather easily. Why this, he muzed.
</p>, <p>
This  retro one Ambi is fit enough to cross dirt tracks, many thought.  But, those who brought it to Oz are friends. They should not be perfunctorily brushed aside. So, agreed for the race. Took some handicaps, on their own. Changed a couple of original tires to spare ones. 
</p>, <p>
Somehow, Ambi won the 1st race!

It is unfortunate that you have been watching cricket or any sport for 30 long years Zona and still didnt develop the common sense to understand that 'population' has nothing to do with being good at sports. Else China, Indonesia, India and the United States would have ruled world sports. Shocking really (i mean for you personally to remain the same without any intellectual development in this regard). Dont alas that much. India has won 2 out of their 3 world titles outside 'Asia' if that makes you happy. They have won series everywhere , even in countries that are famous for fast bowling legends (or pitches for that matter). Again, if anything is a wonder, it is your selective memory despite your line 'i am watch cricket for 30 years' to forget these facts. That being said, it is a shame that india rarely produces legendary fast bowlers. But that has nothing to do with 'population' or winning. They have won nevertheless. The lack of common sense and bias shows zona..keep a lid on it.

@sreehk: Agreed that Aus have good line up when they come to T20 world cup. For your information, Starc and Pattison is not rested but injured. We have seen what Lyon is capable of with ball in shorter format already. Above all you forgot that they are laying in spinning friendly wickets as compared to Aussie pitches. Smithy played a game as well as Davy. Mitch Marsh, Finch, Watto, Wade, Maxi, Jimmy all played in the T20s and they could not change anything in Aussie pitch.  India have 2 batters (Manish and Rahane) from the squad who are yet to get a chance in T20 and we have better bowlers like Shami, Chahal, Mishra and even Chawla  and batters like Jadhav, S Yadav, M Agarwal and Mandeep still sitting back in India. I don't think we have to worry too much

Some of the comments I read here are very funny. People talking about Australian c team playing. Come one guys please accept that Australia has lost the match and the series and lost it very badly. At the end of the day the team playing better cricket has to win the match. Indians batted way better than Australian and their bowlers knows how to pressurise the Australian middle order. If Indian spinners are so effective  on these dead Australian pitches then imagine their magic on live indian piches. And please guys stop hate to the opposition team and players. Please enjoy the cricket. Good luck to both teams for the Sunday clash.

@rajarajan99  - Australians aren't whining.  There's no reason too.  They were experimenting with their second string side here. Nothing to read into the result except who might be ready to step up for the T20 world cup.

@zona, well you are watched cricket for 30 years but did not realise Ishant Sharma, M Shami, U Yadav, V Aaron are well past 140k but the problem with India is the worship of batsmen. That's why India produced better batters than bowlers. You don't need million population because only 11 can play so, it doesn't matter what is the population. if all the population wants to play cricket, then India would not a super power when it comes to space sciences, Engineering, software, medicine and management.  Apart from India all cricket playing countries, including Pakistan, have population of more than 11 which is enough for a cricket team, so population doesn't matter at the end of the day. BTW, which country you're coming from (sure not English speaking countries) and perhaps we can discuss about the population versus development I guess. Another note about the Oz bowling attack, it is not India's fault that Oz bowlers are injured or batsmen did not play, Cricinfo, please publish

I'm a bit mystified as to what Australia is doing at the moment. If they want to try out some new players what are players like Hastings and Shaun Marsh doing in the side? If they want to win this series, why are so many first-team players missing?
</p>
<p>
The T20 WC is coming up, the next big ICC tournament. This really doesn't look like the way to prepare for it. As an England fan, this looks rather like the way England prepared for the 2015 WC and we all saw how that worked out for them.

@Zona, can you name one decent spinner that Australia produced who had some success in India's dust bowls pitches? Why on earth should it be superior to produce fast bowlers when the 'mighty' Australian batsmen would keep getting bundled out by half decent swing bowlers from other countries? If my memory serves me right, it was 4-0 down for Australia on their last trip to India and India did manage 2-0. Be prepared to lick the wounds after another 4-0 later in the year!

If the results of the deal between India, Australia and England is pitches like this whenever India visit, then I'm going to watch baseball instead.
I've never seen a duller, more batsman favouring series of games, aimed purely at the Indian market.

I was surprised to read that Smith and Warner, two of fastest scorers in world cricket, have been rested. I wondered why. But then I read cricinfo's text commentary that Australia does not respect this format. I wonder why? But then I read there were 82,000 people in Melbourne to watch BBL (but only 55,000 here)???
</p>
<p>
By playing a 2nd or 3rd string (as cricinfo's text commentator stated) side, it has taken sheen out of India's victory. But nevertheless a series win in Australia is extremely rare and should be celebrated.

@ZONA - Maybe we can't bowl 140+ but still thrashed your "pace attack" in the last 3 of 7 matches. Rest of the time your "pace attack" was only shredded to 300+ totals by 3 people. LOL. I am waiting for the day when you will produce another genuine spinner like warne. Till then tours to India look grim like last time and before that and so on.

It's 20/20. The result means nothing. In a day's time. No one will even remember the game took place. I think you can see how seriously Australia takes it by the fact that they played a team full of park cricketers.  The real question is how much money did CA make from the game? That's all 20/20 is there for.

Not sure what Australians experimenting has achieved but with such a limited time to find best team for world cup it had to be done. The problem is the bowling their will be no Starc in world cup so no point mentioning him. Note the wide lines India bowl Australia are really struggling with that. Tye put in a good audition, Watto has bowled well but the others have been rubbish. Then twice cruising towards big targets before imploding. The Aussies arent far off and wouldnt discount them in the world cup but here we have been beaten in what we have always been better at fielding and bowling.

No Finch as well as no Starc. Aus may as well not even bother going to the t20 wc, though the preparations until this series have not been the best. Not as bad as Aus prep for the Nz series, but it was started too late regardless. Aus still can't play spin / slow flat bowling in regards to being able to go up a gear without getting out. P.s. Wade is inconsistent as always (batting, running...), but too late to try anything else now.

For all who crying third tier team and saying Australia strong eleven will hit India like a storm in wc,jus remember both warner and smith played in the 1st t20 and they lose, and in the 2nd t20 India spinners pull the game bk in Australian conditions, imagine what they will do on Indian pitches. Once again looking for excuses blaming their own pitches when getting good competitive cricket from india at home and then complaining about Indian pitches when playing India in India,running from an in form Bangladesh team! Any way, plz don't break Usmand spirit plz play the guy Australia!

Smith, Warner played in the first t20 and Aussies lost, Maxwell played in the2nd and they still lost. Except for Starc i dont think anyone is left to play, who will be ineffective in India.Look at his record in India.

Just wondering if Cricket Australia will ever take T20 as seriously as the rest of the world.  Sure the team picked tries when out there, but team selections are constantly a smorgasbord of new faces in the search for someone new that then may eventually feed the ODI or Test team, rather than putting the best XI on the field.  How else to explain Finch as Captain when Smith is in the team.  Is he the future?  Putting microphones on players helps TV ratings not team performance.  All combine to make T20 an "exhibition" event for the fans.  A breather until the next Test series comes along.

I posted something the other day that didn't pass the muster of the censors. I still haven't cracked their code. I had written that I was surprised that Smith even played in the 4th and 5th ODIs given his hip condition. I had also said that it would be no surprise if UK comes in for the 3rd T20 simply so he has a bit of crease time prior to the NZ tour. Injuries to some extent have changed the composition of the AUS side. That much is obvious. But can we just focus on context here? The T20 WC is 6 weeks away on vastly different tracks. Between then and now AUS has to go and play in conditions they are supposed to not favor in TEST CRICKET! Why you would even think about having your top guys play in slog mode prior to that is beyond me. The ODI build up is as best as they can do in NZ and while that isn't great it's &gt; T20.

Australia's stand-in team of retirees and unknowns didn't make the grade, but there were very few locals there to watch anyway.  Really why bother with these meaningless T20 games after the planned event - India being soundly thrashed and just escaping a whitewash in the ODI series.  They will need to find spinners who can spin and pace bowlers with some pace.

@Zona At what speed does Umesh Yadav and Varun Aaron bowl? Even in the recently concluded ODI series at what speed did Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma bowl? At what speed did Srinath and Agarkar bowl in 1998? At what speed did Ishant Sharma bowl in the VB series in 2008 in Australia? At what speed did Zaheer, Nehra and Srinath bowl at WC 2003? At what speed did Sreesanth and RP bowl at WT20 in SA in 2007? Because the average speed in each of the above mentioned cases were consistently more than 140k. The speed gun doesn't lie, right?

@zona: wish u hv been watching indian team a little closely..with ur comment it seems u hv been just watching for past 2-3 years..n if u tok of pace we still have shami, umesh and varun who bowls at 145+. U talked about past 30 years, I am giving u few names go and check there speed when dey were young. Srinath had bowled a bowl of 155 kph in 99 then zaheer khan bowled 149 kph in 2003 and nehra bowled at 149 in 2003 wc and ishant touched 152. N if u tok of a drop in pace even ur macgrath wasn't 140+ after turning 30 . Every country has some trends of players like india produce batsman , den pak is known for fast bowlers, Wi for power hitter Yes australia has a good team but that doesnt give u right to criticise them ..even australia has been thrashed in india 4-0 and won just a single test series in past 18 years.N u know what u will never watch a time a like india ..ur comments has more frustration than logic

Every country has some trends of players like india produce batsman , den pak is known for fast bowlers, Wi for power hitter Yes australia has a good team but that doesnt give u right to criticise them ..even australia has been thrashed in india 4-0 and won just a single test series in past 18 years.N u know what u will never watch a time a like india ..ur comments has more frustration than logic

Well played India. Peaking at the right time with the World T20 in the horizon. I am convinced that we are favorites also considering the tournament is at our home. But we should shed any complacency. While Oz are not a great T20 team, there are other teams like Windies, N Zealand who can cause an upset. I have doubts about England in sub-continent. Pakistan are a mediocre T20 side and S Africa are perennial chokers.
@Zona, isn't Australia outside Asia? And aren't we winning? Give some credit. Our lads can bowl quite fast, in fact faster than many other teams' fast bowlers.
All these excuses of Oz not playing their best team doesn't hold water. They said Maxwell will make a difference in the 2nd match. What happened? Maxwell came and went. Even we were missing Rahane, Shami, among others. Please accept that we are the better side.
Kohli has confirmed his stature as the best batsman in the world. Go India.

Agarkar: why does  your videos not show any match highlights? I believe adding few clips related to the discussion adds a lot of value to your videos. Especially in a live match, viewers don't get the opportunity to watch a clip from different camera angles (with slow motion). Adding such videos will give us the opportunity to understand more about what actually happened.

I am not an Indian fan but I have seen enough today to say that Indian batting has come of age and at this moment they are number 1. I don't agree with Agarkar that India has got best top 3 batsman. Infect I think they have best top 5 if you include Rehane and Dhoni not to mention Yuvraj. But I think Australians could have won this match if they played better after a brilliant start. They could have played spinners by taking 6-7 runs on a large ground and start hitting out in the last 3-4 overs with wickets in hands. But all credit goes to the winning team who came up with a better plan. At least they are getting some benefit from IPL.

Great job India on winning the T20 series in Aus .. Really good performance by both teams .. Fast bowling and later middle order batting still a problem for India and hopefully they can sort it out before the big WC T20 .. Top 3 batters looking great and will be key in WC .. Tired of comments that Aus dont have their key players n bowlers injured, not India's fault .. Aussies get stifled by spinners even on a flat concrete pitch .. dont even want to think what will happen in India when the ball turns decently (which is termed as dust bowls by non subcontinental players) .. Barring Smith and Maxwell I dont see other Aus batsmen playing spin well .. Though I think WC pitches will be flat tracks as well and we can see their batsmen perform well and make it a good contest

India 'won' because we had our 3rd team out. That's the only way they could ever beat us too. They love the T20 stuff whereas we will always smash them in the proper game: Test cricket. They are cowards against the short ball whereas we have no fear.

Haha  Zona India have won 2 ODI World Cups  and one T20 World Cup plus 2 Champions Trophy. Most of them outside India. We have Umesh Yadav, Varun Aaron and Ishant  Sharma all bowling over 140 kmph.
But today  is not the day to get into silly arguments. Congrats India , very proud of this team. Hope you guys performance with the same intensity in the T20 WC

To me, there is nothing much to cheer in Twenty-Twenty cricket. If things go wrong there is almost no chance of return in Twenty-Twenty cricket. Only thing to rejoice is that after a long time Indian cricket team is lucky in Australia and for once it seemed that Milos Raonic was inspired by V.Kohli's stellar performance in Australia. This is only third series victory in 26 attempts for India in Australia. For Ranchi Rhino the firm left foot did wonders and addition of  Bumrah, Nehra provided Ranchi Rhino the "ripcord" to success. Indian cricket administrators have to learn a lot from Australian pitch preparation.  It is best for Indian cricket if ready-made pitches are imported from Australia or South Africa.

@OMAR ABBASI: Yes, India beat the OZ team without Warner, Smith, Starc &amp; Hazzlewood. India did not request these guys to be not play! Warner &amp; Smith played in T20 #1, which Aussies Lost handsomely! As for Starc &amp; Hazzlewood, their fitness varies from match to match. Starc had many injuries &amp; the Aussies dare not risk playing him for the fear of another injury. Hazzlewood played in ODI #1 &amp; was not very effective. In T20,  pace of the bowler matters little as Tate @154 KPH was  clobbered in T20 #1.  But the important point here is India scored 184 for "just 3 wkts". Had Finch &amp; Marsh's multiple chances were taken, this team would have been bundled for 100 to 120 runs! After losing the First T20, the Aussies realised that T20 was not their cup of tea! So Warner &amp; Smith decided to take a flight to NZ, Instead for their next series!.

Surprised at some of the excuses....remember double standards ?
Australians dont care for t20 ....but these matches have attendance more than worldcup ODIs and Tests'
This is 3rd string team .....this is the best of BBL, so the league has to be 3rd string.
India's main bowler Shami didn't play in ODIs , so was Starc...thats all...
AUS at present have just one quality bowler.Any other AUS bowler would have been clobbered.

Am I the only one to feel that this wasn't the worse of Australian attacks, look at it Lyon, watto, Faulkner. Given the no. of injuries Australia have had, this is the best they have got (again not a bad line-up to have) and India proved they were superior on several counts. And tye looks one hell of a talent, it would be a disservice to call him a part of an Australia c attack. It is not as if Bumrah or Pandya have played 100 tests each! Or Yuvraj is Dan Vettori, even Ashwin was supposed to have been a dust-bowl spinner till last week. The thing is Indians have been the better side, though they can still improve with their totals. And please don't rush in with your judgments on Pandya, He has bowled five overs and hasn't batted at all, so lets wait and watch.

Oh my god, so much of jealously, Seems never ending! India didn't ask Aus to field their weakened team, they've beaten Australia in Australia which is undoubtedly an achievement for any country....moreover I can notice that it's our neighbours who have more problem than Aus that Indians have clinched this series 2-0 with one match to go! Both teams have fielded 2-3 new players and Aus lost few players due to injury which has happened with India also in case of Rahane n Shami....

@Zona: It seems you haven't watched cricket enough then in the last 30 years. India has produced several fast bowlers that can bowl over 140 kph. And it has nothing to do with the population. India doesn't have a big sporting culture. Out of the 1 billion, maybe .01% get to seriously think about sports as a career unlike some other countries. But don't worry though, we are doing fine without express bowlers like Tait. LOL. In fact we have beaten SA, SL, Pak, WI, BD and Zim very easily when we played them in the world cup in Aus. "Pasted" them to quote you. So you don't need express pace to be successful, as you can also see from this recent series win. It's pretty sad that someone who has been following cricket for 30 years doesn't know that there is more to cricket than raw pace.

People are blaming india for not heaving a good fast bowler. Can anyone gurantees that any bowler from the globe will bowl well against mighty Australian batsmans in T20i? India have quite good fast bowling line up, but they have a fabulous batting capacity. They actually show us the way in which T20 games should be played. A fan from BD

@ZONA: You  have an unhealthy obsession with Indian team , why don't you concentrate on Pakistan cricket team.  You said you have been watching cricket for last 30 years but it looks like last you watched cricket was 30 years back because in those three decades there have been so many bowlers from India who have bowled 140 plus, from current team Umesh Yadav,Varun Aaron,Ishant Sharma ,Bumrah heck even 36 year old Nehra bowls at 140 KPH .Anyways pace without swing,seam,control and accuracy is vastly overrated.I clearly remember Irfan Pathan and Balaji comfortably outbowling much faster Shoaib Akhtar and Mohd Sami when India toured Pak in 2002/03. As for Australia having B or C attack it is all subjective and it does not say much about Australian bowling stocks if there B or C attack is this toothless. Point is when Australians themselves are not offering any excuses then why the heck are you getting so rattled ???

These Australian players are the worst players of spin(in fact seam,swing and all)Of all test playing nations..Part time bowler yuvraj singh is making them dance to his tunes..there goes the series, this time in their own concrete flat pitches..Believe me this team cannot even beat Afghanistan in spin friendly Indian conditions..mark my words..cricinfo please publish

Well Zona - thats definitely below the belt. You need not like us. But be rationale. Have you been watching the ODI series in Australia or something else? If you look at the speed charts of all the matches - Indian fast bowlers clocked more than Aus did. I agree that we havent had a 140 + fast bowler in test cricket who could give us match winning edge often. That said, who has mate? Every bowler is a tiger at home and anything but a tiger outside home. Eitherway, i dont see any logic getting to you with all the thickness in your comment. Good luck. I hope whichever team you support consistently produces 140 + fast bowlers - who can show us how to win a test match with that speed in India :)

@zona Calling indian pitches as dust bowls shows the inability to take up the challenge to perform. SA are bad players of spin at this moment so they lost. If it is all talking about pitches and their behaviour the so called roads in Australia now have lost their character mainly Perth for pace. Its not about producing 140KMPH fast bowlers. Look at the pace bowling of current Australian line up except Shaun tait no one hits 140mark consistently. Shaun being able to bowl 140 didn't maintain line and was dropped for second match. Your knowledge of 30 years is just an eyewash for yourself watching the game so far. There are only flat tracks and now better bats. This is international cricket and there is no 1st class 2nd class and 3rd class bowling attacks. So enjoy the game as it goes.

@Zona, I too have been a cricket follower for the past 25 yrs. As much I am tempted to agree tht Indian pace bowlers are found wanting at times, I dont agree with ur comparison of the population. Though Cricket has a big following, Ind is versatile in sports. Sania Mirza who won the doubles title in the Aus open, Abhinav Bindra, Vijendar Singh, Paes, Mahesh Boopathy, Saina Nehwal, Deepika Pallikal, are some e.g.s of other sports ppl who have tasted success. So dont conclude tht the billion population is taking to only cricket. 
</p>
<p>
Indian pitches are spinner friendly, hence we produce good spinners. I dont see anyone complaining abt Aus producing quality pacers and not spinners. Those millions invested on cricket has seentoday the Ind womens team winning the series in Aus not just the men. 
</p>
<p>
Ind isnt a club team, anyone with true cricket sense can see that. If you dont like the Ind team, its fine, ur entitled to have ur opinion, but plz dont drag the population into such discussions.

@zona. When was the last time India had a potent bowling attack. Bowling was never India's strength in pace department. Yet India won 2011 wc , 2013 champions trophy in England they reached 2014 t20 final in Bangladesh and 2015 semifinal they have never lost a game prior to that in the world cup. You can win only if you perform as a team. And calling AUS team as Class C in t20s and Class B in ODIs is absolute disgrace . Chris Lynn was player of the series in BBL , it was not Indians or bcci who kept khawaja out of playing in the T20s when he is on terrific form. AUS batting order has better depth than indian team batting order. Playing till Faulkner who is also an able finisher. When you don't play as a team you never win. T20 games bring in entertainment but one has to understand if ICC T20 is Worldcup to show case your best skills. AUS not caring about T20 cricket is their problem. Any sport is for entertainment be it tests odis or t20. Calling indian pitches are dust bowls show case

Australia generally wins by making the opponent ill at ease the format they are playing. In test they bat as if it is an ODI at 5 RPO and force the Opponents test batsmen to score at the same rate. If Opponents didnt, the Australian players,  ex players and their media bash them as defensive play and negativity blah blah. Opponents captain has to be a zen to remain out of the din or else swept away, In ODI too they reduced the number of fielders out side the circle ( by changing the rules)so they can play it as a T20. Alas they don't have any other format left for T20. So in T20 they will will have to say they are interested only in Test, lets play at 3 RPO and see who wins?. Can they invent any other format like 5 over or 1 over so that they can win T20 easily.

Not sure Indian fans Realise as well that Australia has to start ODI games in NZ on 3rd of Feb, last game of T20 is 31st of Jan. That is why some players are being rested. Simply put there is to much cricket being crammed into short spaces these days. Australia are just prioritizing the NZ tour at the moment. The upcoming test series is important and the ODI series over there will let the players get used to the conditions. Blame the administrators for not seeing a more complete Australia outfit for these T20's with India.

Not sure Indian fans Realise as well that Australia has to start ODI games in NZ on 3rd of Feb, last game of T20 is 31st of Jan. That is why some players are being rested. Simply put there is to much cricket being crammed into short spaces these days. Australia are just prioritizing the NZ tour at the moment. The upcoming test series is important and the ODI series over there will let the players get used to the conditions. Blame the administrators for not seeing a more complete Australia outfit for these T20's with India.

Its so hard to digest when people compare Virat and Smith. Its like comparing Dhoni and Mike Hussey. Both are good finishers, but Hussey plays proper cricket shots which is always a treat to watch. Here Kohli is a class apart, you can ask youngsters to watch him play and learn. But it's better for youngsters if they don't try to learn from Smith. I wonder if Smith can play a proper cricket shot! He looks awful when he shuffles across. I never enjoyed watching his game, I never believed he has the qualities to bat at no.3 in tests!

Zona I guess you are a SA fan hurt by your team's twin Test series defeats in India and against England at home. The opposition is Australia and whom to select is each team's prerogative.Not India's fault if Australia don't play Warner,Khawaja and any other player.The Aussie XI also did not have greats like Bradman,Gilchrist,Hayden,Border or Waugh.What do you expect India to do in that case-not celebrate this success!

@ZONA: Your large population theory is wrong. Look Bangladesh has such a large population compared to Hong Kong. But HK defeated Bangladesh. Zimbabwe also has far less population than BD.  Then how do they win?According to you China should have the fastest pace bowler in the world. They do not even have any cricketer. India is winning with the pacers they already have. Indians do not believe in overdoing things. There is a right dose of medicine for every disease. Indian team knows the right dose for each team. Cool off Zona, Cool off.

Comment from a fan clearly jealous of Indian cricket.Elated at India's first ever bilateral series win in any form of the game in Australia. Though India has never won a Test series and may not win in the immediate future with the paucity of quality pacers,this bilateral series win is a fitting reply to those Aussie fans who were pointing fingers at the fact that India have never won any series of supposed significance in Australia though India did win the B &amp; H WC in 1985.

For people who are saying Aus fielded their C team - please grow up and admit defeat. If Aussies fielded their C team, I think India also did no field their best team:
We had Bumra and pandya who are making their debut. 
We got Yuvraj Singh, who hasn't played an international match in years!
We are missing Shami.
We did not even Play Rahane.
</p>
<p>
Aussie fans, please stop making excuses and admit that India was a better side in the first two matches. Aussies choked and could not finish the game. This just goes to show the depth in the Aussie side.

AUS should pick Brad Hogg,Usman Khawaja,Ashton Agar,Brad hodge as these players are experienced and can perform in indian conditions.These new players like Lynn and Heads will not helpful against spin in indian conditions.As there are two strong sides with good spin options in AUS group like PAK and IND.And both teams have 3 to 4 spin bowling options.

Australia missing only Starc &amp; Hazlewood &amp; claiming to be 3rd string. With 1st string team, Aus yet to win a test in India since 2004. Single test series win in India in 47 years. For Aussie fans claiming no interest in T20 cricket making fools of themselves as recently concluded BBL with huge crowds suggests otherwise. Cricinfo please publish.

no starc, no bailey, no khawaja, no cummins, no pattinson, no warner , no smith, no mitch marsh,. These players will be at the t20 world, Aus is just checking bench strength. Dont get too excited indian fans you will face a completely different team at the t20 world cup. This is like an aus C team. But i guess you shud get excited since you havnt won any series here for ages.

I am watch cricket for last 30 years but have not seen a team like India.... they have failed to produce ONE single genuine fast bowler who could regularly make it 140+ kph.... a population of more than 1 billion which is 16% of world population and yet dragging some fast spinners as fast bowler with tag "fast bowlers" for their bit longer run ups.... funny though but so pathetic to see they are pouring millions in cricket to earn billions but alas no fast bowler.... 
</p>
<p>
no wonder they are pasted outside Asia like club teams....

Indian fans, let's not too excited.  Smith and Warner didn't play and their bowling wasn't top T20 class.  With that said, here are a few things that stand out from the second T20.  Sharma just oozes class, Kohli just oozes batsmanship and arrogance, Jadeja's catch, bowling and fielding are a great plus, Bumrah is the only bowler in a nation of 1.2+billion who can bowl well in the death overs and India/BCCI are finally playing youngsters who are contributing.   While T20 is nowhere at the level of Test cricket or ODIs, it provides good entertainment.  The upcoming T20 should be fun to watch but NZ, England, Australia and even BL can upstage the upstart India so India needs to get a good balanced team (or just prepare rank turners in which case PK, BD and even SL might stand a chance of winning).   Well done India but don't get too far ahead of yourselves.

KUSANAGI119 - Care to comment how was India lack luster during the ODI series? All the games went to the wire. It is obvious that Australian public care more about T-20's than test cricket or ODI. 55,000 came in today.  Attendance during Big bash was more than during the ODI world cup. Get ready for a white wash at home.

From this series, few points are re-confirmed.
(1) India must assure as many runs from their power-play. (2) Aussies pitches are not same threatening anymore. They are absolutely dead pitches, more like a concrete with no spin or swing. (3) India need help from their spinners to control match. Once it is there, no team can beat them. (4) India still cannot capitalize in their death overs. Yet to see an over of 20+ runs (5) India finally learned well on how to use bigger grounds and keep making easy 2-3 runs. (6) Most Aussie batsmen are still struggling against spin once applied. Good for them that there was no seam swing from pitch. (7) Never bowl Aussies a chest high bounce. They are good at that. (8) Spin or pace - Yorkers are best bowling choices. (9) MSD has past his prime and he may never be the same (10) Using proper line-length you can control most batsmen. (11) There can be a bad day for any bowler in the team. (12) Good fielding is a must for winning. Good Luck..

Relax Team India, Dhoni and Shastri. Australia fielded their 3rd grade side. Warner, Smith, Mitch Marsh, Starc, Pattison, Cummins were all rested. Aussies are prepping for WC T20 and will field their strongest eleven when all brutal force will hit India. Look at below eleven:
</p>
<p>
1.Warner 2.Finch 3.Smith 4.Maxwell 5.Watson 6.Wade 7.Faulkner 8. MitchMarsh 9.Lyon 10.Hastings/Boland 11.Starc

Brutal batting that goes till 8 and all big hitting. 5 pacers, 2 spinners. That is when India will be tested and twisted.

Congrat India! This Indian XI is a far superior to the Aussies in T20. If India had played the ODI Series with the same T20 squad, they would have Won at least 4-1. Sending such an unbalanced ODI squad with no "Finishers" in the squad like Raina &amp; Hardik Pandya defied logic. Even the specialist bats chosen were just 5. Axar Patel + 2 of the pace bowlers could have given way to Bumrah + the 2 finishers. India should sweep the T20 series 3-0 if they play to their potential. Today Finch was dropped thrice otherwise the Aussies might have been All out for 120 at best. Bumrah, Jadeja &amp; Ashwin have once again showed the way in bowling. The Aussie bowling got just 3 Wkts. India can do well in the WC 2016 with may be one change. Only Yuvraj is unproven in Form &amp; needs to show it in the third T20. Well done India- Complete the sweep!

Aswin bowled very well. There was no mention of the TWO dropped catches in one of his overs. Good to see Dhoni still showing his fast reflexes in the stumpings and his timely,shuffling of bowlers.

Kudos to India for winning the T20 series.  Few days before MS was a villain but since he won last ODI and this series seldom there is talk of him!  MS brings urgency into the running between wickets.  His bowling changes were quite good.  While India took some stunning catches they also dropped some.  I don't know whether it would have been easy for India had Aussies batted Warner, Smith and Finch did not have the injury which made him uncomfortable while batting.
</p>
<p>
Kohli is in the best form of his life.  Bhumrah is the find of the series even though he is learning that it is not easy to maintain success in international cricket without developing new ways!

Full credit to the way Ashwin and Jadeja have bowled in both the games leaving the Australian batsmen clueless.

<p>
Can't leave out Khawaja with the form he's in
Batsmen like Lynn and Wade don't deserve to be in the squad. Surely a better keeper-batsman out there?

Congrats Indian team for  winning a bilateral series outside of Subcontinent and West Indies after a long time .Throughout this Australian tour there have been some fans posting here claiming to be Australian fans but when in reality they aren't and are just bandwagoning so they could bash Indian team whenever they have lost (sadly quite often) we all know who they are and what nationalities they actually represent. Real Australian fans will either stay away from comment section or be gracious and sporting enough to congratulate India.Don't say Australians don't care about T20 because then how do you explain the super success of BBL ?? By constantly repeating that Australian bowling attack is 2nd or 22nd string you are disrespecting your own cricketers and even conceding the fact that beyond Hazelwood,Starc and Pattinson Australian bowling stocks are threadbare .But as i said real Australian fan will never do that.

Congrats Indian team for  winning a bilateral series outside of Subcontinent and West Indies after a long time .Throughout this Australian tour there have been some fans posting here claiming to be Australian fans but when in reality they aren't and are just bandwagoning so they could bash Indian team whenever they have lost (sadly quite often) we all know who they are and what nationalities they actually represent. Real Australian fans will either stay away from comment section or be gracious and sporting enough to congratulate India.Don't say Australians don't care about T20 because then how do you explain the super success of BBL ?? By constantly repeating that Australian bowling attack is 2nd or 22nd string you are disrespecting your own cricketers and even conceding the fact that beyond Hazelwood,Starc and Pattinson Australian bowling stocks are threadbare .But as i said real Australian fan will never do that.

A fine win by Team India. At the same time, it's really sad to see so many excuses by some sections of the Australian fans that they 'do not care' for T20s, 'oh, this was a second/third string' side blah blah blah. The fact is, Australia are simply not good enough in this format. Come the WT20, conditions will be even tougher, with slow, spinning pitches. I cannot see Australia doing anything of significance during that tournament. I also thought keeping Khawaja benched was a cardinal sin given the form he's in. Shaun Marsh has had his chances in T20s, he's not cut out for it. Surprising given he has a fantastic record for Kings XI Punjab over the years. Poor Tait, he must be really feeling down. Bowlers always get smashed in T20s, so it was pretty harsh on Tait to miss out. India also have many chinks. They desperately need a 5th bowler if one of the main guys have an off day. And I would like to see a fast bowling all-rounder in the team. Overall, well done men in blue.

There is a saying all good things comes to an end.Australia's golden era is also coming to an end.Golden era's usually doesn't last more than 2 decades.AC Milan's rejuvenation started in 1987,culminating with winning the UCL in 2007,while Barca's rejuvention started in 2004 which is likely to end around 2024-25 when Messi,Iniesta,Busquets,Pique&amp;co. will be gone or past their prime.Similarly Australia's rise to cricketing power started with winning away test series against legendary WI in 1995 which also propelled them to no.1 ranking.Since then they have  reached 5 WC finals,winning 4 and also won 2 ICC Champions Trophy.That golden era has reached it's course by winning the ICC WC in 2015 and this Australia team is due to struggle in ICC tournaments in forseeable future.Only time will tell how right/wrong I am,but If I'm proven wrong,remind me Australia national cricket team fans.

I'm an Indian fan and I'm thrilled about our series win in about 8 years in Australia. But I must say that Aus management is undergoing a bit of brain freeze.  Whose brilliant idea was it to drop Smith and Warner - it is like India deciding to drop Kohli and Sharma. If it had anything to do with a disciplinary move w.r.t to commentary on Ch 9, then that is something that needs a bit of introspection.   India is yet figuring out how to bowl to Smith and Aus decides to drop /rest (whatever) him.   Wake up Aus - Smith Warner Finch Bailey and Maxwell in that order is your best batsman.  Bring them on for the last game in order for it to be a close, entertaining one.

To those saying that Aus supporters only denigrate T20 as being unimportant when we lose - most of us still feel its unimportant even when we win. Evidenced probably best by the fact that people will struggle to remember the opposition we played months ago let alone the result. Also a lot of people pointing to the success of the Big Bash League as "evidence" we care about T20. The success of the BBL is far more likely to be attributed to the format catering to the generally shorter attention spans and time constraints of the average person in this day and age. A shorter, faster game means people can take a few hours of their time, be entertained and go home. That does not equate to caring about the result in any meaningful way. Also, I daresay the somewhat lack-lustre opposition in the West Indies and India in the ODIs contributed to more people tuning in to the Big Bash. So for all the reasons stated above, yes, we don't care about the T20 and no Big Bash is not evidence against.

That is a top draw fielding unit for India. Raina, Jadeja, Kohli, Yuvraj, Pandya, Rohit Sharma, Yadav, Bumrah are excellent fielders. Ashwin has impressed with his fielding too - surprisingly. Mohit Sharma is another who is excellent fielder too. So, irrespective of batting or bowling gains - fielding i believe is the major gain.

The friendly ties between CA and BCCI means that there is almost an Aussie A team playing Ind. Dwan and Ruhit Surma played well against bowler who might not play in the WT20i.e. John Wayne Hastings, Scott Boland, AJ Tye. Then Ind won by sheer luck after a blistering opening stand between Shaun Edward Marsh and Aaron James Finch. Then Pendi got inexperienced Chris Austin Lynn out and Jedaje took a catch which he wouldn't have taken on other days to dismiss Shane Robert Watson and the runout by Jedaj ended the game. Kholee didn't really deserv that m o m award as he had runout Surma who could have easily taken Ind past 200.

India won a t2o series, whoopee doo. They couldn't win a one day series when the ICC saw to it the pitches were a batting paradise. Isn't it amazing every time India come here the pitches are flat?

Tye played well, so did Finch. Finchs' captaincy, however, remains unconvincing. Aussies lack consistency and competence against slow bowling. As a fan, it is dissapointing to see this has not changed despite being so obvious for such a long time. Well played India. Kohli is a supreme talent, even if he is supremely irritating.

Not the strongest Australian side but the margins were very convincing and Yuvi or Raina hardly played very major roles. Everyone knows the damage they can do once they fully engage.

There is no such thing as A B C D E F G teams. When you play your 11 in an international it represents your nation, your talent, your bench strength. And don't compare formats. Every format has its own unique flavour. Some have a liking for tests, some like T20 more. Congrats India.

Well done India ! Great performance by both batsman and bowlers. Still need some improvements in fielding . India should carry on this good work and beat Aussies 3-0 ! That will some achievement  . Expect Aussies to get desperate and make more changes for the last game...They hate losing !!

I had commented on many India domestic cricket articles on this website before even the ODI series started that India needed Pandya (who I believe if nurtured properly will become a world class all-rounder in all formats) and Bumrah and I feel vindicated. I knew Rishi Dhawan was useless slow medium having seen a lot of domestic games and I was correct there too. The only disappointment was Gurkeerat; his fielding is bad and bowling was worse than Sehwag. Sran impressed me; he has some talent as he gets some zip off the pitch. But the most surprising and most pleasing find was how well Pandey shepherded that 331 chase. Experimenting with new players has been the biggest plus point in this tour. Now when can we give chances to Shreyas Iyer (all formats), Karun Nair (all formats), Unmukt Chand (only in ODI), Nathu Singh (only in ODI), Shardul Thakur (only in test), Mayank Aggarwal (only in ODI) and Sanju Samson (in ODI and T20)? I advise the Indian selectors to do it right after IPL.

India are a very important team of limited over formats and now in full flow to win this T20 worldcup. Really surprised that despite big cash league aussies faltering even at home. Interesting part is when aussies full strength for the world t20 then conditions will be spinning and slow wickets. Let's see interesting.

Don't understand why Tait was dropped after only 1 match into comeback. If the plan was to try him out before the WC T20, he should play every game. Instead of warming the bench, he would rather play MCL.

"What could of happened if, Siddle, Starc, Hazelwood, Khwaja, Cummings and etc are playing??". Siddle, Khawaja and Cummings were neither picked nor would they have threatened India if they were picked . They ARE third string players anyway. Only first string players that were missing were Starc and Hazelwood. The other nine players were first string. India were missing Shami and Raina too and they were playing the likes of Rishi Dhawan, Gurkeerat Singh and Manish Pandey who were playing their first series in Aus. So if Aus was a C team so was India, And India didn't get humiliated. They competed very well and completed a record chase in Sydney even with their C team.

Calling the team as second Tier team definitely underestimate their own team...And saying T20 is not consider important even after Big Bash had a record turnout this year is a mere excuse..... Lets face it, you can play with only 11 players no matter how many international players to have.

Now Australia will plan to select a fourth string side by dropping maxwell, watson etc. so that they wont be blamed for a loss in the final t20. I dont think they would pick Khawaja either.

As usual, typical aussie response. If they lose odi, they say test is real cricket and they care least bit about odi, now as they lose in t20 here goes the words that aussies mastered in "t20 is the lowest form of cricket we don't care." Well you don't but ironically BBL is a big hit and every aussie wait all the year to cheer for their teams but yeah when they lose, its the lowest form of cricket. Someone console this guys or they will go into depression.

Australia should give fair number of chances to Cameron Boyce. He bowled reasonably well in the last match. As far as I see he has the potential to find a place in the side especially in the shorter format of the game. His legbreak bowling is impressive. If Australia is really looking for a good spin bowler, they should persist with him for sometime. He may not be that effective against asian teams but definitely he will be handy when aussies play against England, New Zealand &amp; South Africa.

There is no better sight for me in cricket than watching Kohli take the center stage in sporting theaters such as the MCG or SCG.  The skill, the defiance, the blatant self-belief, and the ability to heighten the drama make his batting a must watch sporting spectacle. Great entertainment.

hats to Indian team after winning the t20 series after the onedayers they were beaten convincingly by Australia.please give others Indian  batsmen hit in the middle yuvi,raina,dhoni ,pandya then how you give chance to others at least in next match .Every time the top 3 are batting bulk of the overs, already we have won the series.

WOW what a team india is i mean look at the fielding starderd, look at the batsmen with yuvraj come back, look at the bowler this is the world's no.1 team with no doubt. India will easily win asia cup and t20 wc. Other asian team against india is like a small child.

AUS needs to make sum changes. Wade, Marsh &amp; Lyon r no good in white ball cricket. Only 2 spinners in AUS capable of bowling 4 overs in international T20- M Beer n Brad Hogg. Pick one of them, rest no good. And surely there has to be a better keeper batsman than Wade. May be Whiteman or Handscomb. Aussie fans can say about that. Sumtimes its not about finding who can play its also about finding who can't.

Yes, this wasn't the strongest of Australian sides, but also look at the fact that more than half the Indian side was either new comers or people making comebacks. Not a bad performance at all, wish they continue to experiment and rest Rohit if he is not fully fit. Play Rishi, Mann, Bhajji and Yadav in the next game. Also, need to experiment in the upcoming Sri Lanka series, piyush chawla was quite excellent in the syed mushtaq trophy. Unmukt, mayank Agarwal,  robin, pk and irfan should be tried out. Every game till world t20 is important.

"Kohli, who careered to 59 from 33 balls with some shots of matchless mastery" well said Dan Brettig. To play the cover drive properly needs good amount of skill and practice. To play the cover drive, inside out cover drive, square drive as well as the late drive (I don't what to call that drive through third man region so I named it after late cut; a shot I have never seen previously in my life and that is 25+ years of viewing experience) requires not just mastery but also magical wrists. Virat Kohli has the best wrists in cricket since Azhar, Mark Waugh and VVS.

Why do you say sixth string Australian side? From the team of the first T20, who all are missing? Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins are injured. Other than that who were you missing? Shaun Tait is faster than Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins..

Noted the inclusions of hopefuls and new faces.
Reckon selectors have now a pretty good idea of the WC team.
Lose a battle to win etc.
Rohit, SD and Kohli are the mainstays for India... no surprises.
India seems to do everything better once it drops to T20. Perhaps its the IPL effect. Keeps MS in the loop.
Overall both teams are not too different other than a deeper Oz line as evident in ODIs as well.

India and Australia play a lot of T20 with the IPL and BBL, but its surprising that local Australian BBL stars have not been able to perform in the international stage - be it Head, Lynn, Boland, Tait etc. Experience pays which is why Watson, Kohli, Rohit, Finch have all done well. Why not take in Dave and Mike Hussey next?
</p>
<p>
well played India. Its not often you win a non-dead-rubber in Australia. So feels good. Hope Khwaja gets a game next.

To all who are saying that we should be more concerned about this loss: T20 is and will always be the least credible form of cricket.

Here again the umpiring has been fair and unbias and the result has been what I expected another Australia loss. 11 men against 11 men Australia cannot defeat a well rested Indian squad period. All the fair weather Indian fans will have nice things to say about their cricket team now I'm sure.

@ Herath-UK : Yeah, I agree about your comment regarding the good time for India, just a simple correction, it is certainly going to last a lot more than a 'little more' because SL are yet to win a test and a bilateral series in India.

India got very good top 3 in batting even they lost odi series their top 4 scored most of the runs, middle order really messed up three opertunities to win and blew one in the bag, my favorite batsmen is rohit sharma he is answer to brutal sehwag batting with silk touch, not sure why indian fans criticize him all the time, when he gets out it looks bad, looks like it is soft dismissal but that is how he dispatch a six also, one realize when the ball is over fence. Good win for indian team on aussies turf.

AUS won 4 matches in a row.  Ind won 3 matches in a row.  Let us see who will win the fourth match.   There may be talk of Second string / third string of AUS attack.  If their premium fast bowlers return they may go at same speed as Tait.
</p>
<p>
Anyway let us see the final match and how AUS responds to avoid Brown wash ( similar way Ind managed to avoid white wash at the last mt. )

Really think Aussies missed a trick in these 2 games.Both games they could've won had they opted to bat 1st-Aussies W both the tosses.Don't have to look any further,the stats say it-of all intl t20s till date,teams batting 1st have W 75 p.c of the games!

Aus have to bring in Khawaja as he is inform &amp; he is very wristy which will help Aus maneuver spin attack against all sub continental teams. He reminds me so muuch of Saeed Anwar, not as classy but mighty effective.Maxwell is match winner, on given day he can turn matches single handedly, we have since that time and again in IPL. Bailey too is a must. As lot of you have already pointed out T-20 is tricky format and outcome can fluctuate in matter of overs. India played well today but still think they offered too many short deliveries in first 6 overs. They should try Pandya and Yuvi and Raina as 3,2 &amp; 1 down in next match. But i doubt they will do it. 
My money is on BD for semis as they bat down and have lots of spin options. Historical averages in all countries say that spinners are more effective in shortest format of the game.

Yuvraj should have been selected for ODI series, too, as he made his comeback via 50 over matches. It was a huge blunder on whoever selected the squad's part. His power hitting in last 10 overs and slow spin is exactly what was needed during middle overs as he bowls very slow with an unorthodox angle which forces batsman to play risky shots  to score runs. Gurkeerat Mann is neither a world class batsman nor bowler, same with Rishi Dhawan, who's a part time middle over medium pacer at his best. I don't know what selectors saw on them. Pandya hasn't got chance with his bat, but his bowling is just average. He doesn't know how to bowl according to field placement, basic. We don't have many international caliber all-rounders. If only Irfaan could regain his swing... 
Yuvraj and Pandya needs to bat in 3rd ODI at any cost, including the match for greater cause (ICC World T20).

Today is a redletter day in the annals of Indian sports
1) Indian women beat Aus women in Aus
2) Indian men beat Aus men in Aus (although it is third string team, not our choice)
3) Sania lifting Aus Open
4) Chance for Kohli finishing this t20 series with an average of Infinity.

its surprising that most AUS fans do not care much about T20 whereas their big bash is a big success!...any format u play for country and a win makes u proud...to be fair the ODI could have been  3-2 and now india are 2-0, means they have something of a momentum...the asia cup and SL t20 series will further refine the team for the WC T20...but AUS seem to be taking it lightly...their test team outside AUS is also not so good...anyway they play ODI well..

Talking about T20 WC, It is hard to predict favorites. Because, there is no long time champion team in this format. Of course, it favors the host nation a bit (India) but still it is hard to predict. There are so many moments in this format. Apart from host nation, I think every other team have almost equal chance to win this edition. For instance, South Africa is the best in T20 (considering overall records). We all know they usually jitter when come to big stages. Kiwis &amp; England known to struggle against spin bowling. Aussies can play spin fairly well because of some players. But they have the history of struggling scoring 160+ in T20. In case of Pakistan, Sri Lanka (not sure how their selection going to favor this time), West Indies (we never know) they are all dark horses. So, it is pretty difficult to say who gonna win this edition. As I said, India may have the edge over other teams as they are playing in home conditions, but the rest almost have the equal chance. Let's see!!!

As a die hard SL fan, I am very happy that India won the series. Was disappointed when SL and PAK lost to NZ and IND lost to AUS in ODI series. I just wanted one team from Asia to do well. An IND delivered. Don't care whether they beat a second string AUS team (as many mentioned). Who cares about that. History will say IND beat AUS. Who played doesn't matter. And I am hugely impressed with Virat's batting. Looks like he will break many of Sachin's records. I don't like people calling him next Sachin. They should call him Viral K., not Sachin. Sachin was the master when he played and now it's Virat's turn to take that title.

India missed an opportunity to post 200 today.Just think a score of 200 is a fair reflection of the batting strength of India.India should take the third ODI seriously.The T20 WC is in India but shouldn't expect every wicket to turn.India should plan their strategy based on a flat deck and Indian ground sizes.A spinning track should only be a bonus.Also, catching could've been better as well as the new ball bowling.Pacers should plan to dismiss attacking batsman.Still don't like Ashwin's line.Overall, good win for India none the less but still some room for improvement.

If Australia don't care about t20 they should stop taking about winning t20 world cup they should go and play t20 world cup their preparation for t20 world cup started in a very bad way they rested their key players no plans at all for t20 world cup now they play 3 Odi matches in new Zealand then 2 test then go to Sa play 3 t20 match and then go to India they play only 6 t20 match before world cup and their big players warner smith berly Maxwell play only 3 or 4 t20 matches before world cup Australia will struggle I m sure in india

Good win to be enjoyed &amp; savored by India. I just wish this intensity was shown during the ODI series. Bumrah could have been tried earlier in the ODI series along with Hardik Pandya who definitely is a few yards quicker than Rishi Dhawan &amp; at least looks good enough to bowl like Thisara Perera (if not Shane Watson) .... anyways Indian supporters should not go over board with this win &amp; become bombastic. Australians still do not take this format seriously at international level (they are not even half good as compared to their Test/ODI exploits) in spite of their very successful BBL seasons. Even if India could get few Australian discards such as Watson, Hastings, Dan Christian, Moises Henriques, etc we could be a more consistent side as far as Test/ODIs are concerned.

The rotation policy is back and the results are exactly the same as last time. Last time it was when SL toured, and we went from winning everything to losing everything instantly. Strange, that. 
</p>
<p>
The problem is not so much that the players aren't good, it is that it destroys team harmony and everyone is worse off for it. It does nothing but cheapen the Australian colours and instil the culture of losing in the Australian team. Notably India have not rested any of their best players. We barely have a single one on the park. On the bright idea, Kohli and the Indians get easy games and their arrogant sense of superiority is restored, albeit a delusion.

so the bench strength of aus is exposed badly,mark my word this aus team will be thrashed by Eng in the next ashes,not to forget they can win any tests in subcontinent either,last two series in india they were blanked,got routed by 2-0 in UAE,cant think they will do any better against SA either if Steyn comes back.Even against NZ they provided flat pitches to negate kiwi bowlers.That leaves only WI whom they can beat and probably SL but considering the talented SLankan i wont bet against them in SL either because a slight bit of turn and whole Aus will fold up in a day.Next T20 WC it will be among India,Pak,SA,ENG/BD to win the cup.

This is India's strength. They have a habit of making merry when the opposition is weakened by non cricketing matters. Their fans will now go overboard but don't laugh at them, but be pleased at least something to cheer them up. Another weakened Sri Lanka T20 team has been just announced to meet them &amp; their good time is going to last little more until the Asia &amp; WC.

This looks like a balanced team.2 Allrounders(pace and spin)..2spinners (both allrounders too) &amp; 2 pacers.Rahane is a good player,but no role for a 3rd opening batsmen in final 11.Bumrah is excellent in death bowling with his Yorkers.. No change from this squad needed for T20 world cup in my opinion.

"hazzlewood ,no cummins ,no pattinson " are in effective on Indian pitches.  Of course Warner and Smith are world class batsmen but need to see how they bat when the ball don't come on to bat as fast as in AUS.
</p>
<p>
India's biggest +ve is Virat Kohli who is a no nonsense captain.  If he get 1X and returns 2X, so other players can motivate better in his absence.  The  Kohli/Smith episode in the first T20 is calm just because of them.  If someone pother than them both may be suspended/reprimended and so on
</p>

Let us see weekend match .....Is the brown wash is on?  ( As ashwin said we narrowly missed white wash as IND did n't have correct anticipated score )

For India , it is important to keep both Yuvi and Raina in the T-20 side. These two , along with Virat and Rohit shall form the batting core for India in WT20. I would personally perfer Rahane over Shikhar to open. Rahane is a better fielder and has a proven track record in T-20 unlike Dhawan. While the jury is still out on Pandya, he is closest to the seam bowling all rounder entire India see in its dream and let's persist with him for development purpose. My squad for WT20: 1) Rohit, 2)Rahane, 3)Virat, 4)Yuvi, 5)Raina 6)Dhoni 7)Pandya 8)Jadeja 9)Aahwin 10)Bumrah 11)Shami/Nehra. Manish Pandey, Bhajji, Shikhar, Nehra/Shami and Rishi to be the reserves.

For India , it is important to keep both Yuvi and Raina in the T-20 side. These two , along with Virat and Rohit shall form the batting core for India in WT20. I would personally perfer Rahane over Shikhar to open. Rahane is a better fielder and has a proven track record in T-20 unlike Dhawan. While the jury is still out on Pandya, he is closest to the seam bowling all rounder entire India see in its dream and let's persist with him for development purpose.

Congratzzz Team India!!!! This series win was freakish as Mahi's Stumping of Faulkner and as blinding as Sir. Ravindra Jadeja's ripping catching of Watto. In T20 match balance swings quickly in favour of either team, but with Team India its always losing. Depleted Aussie side gave India chance for redemption after its series of debacles in recent and distant past. Next match is dead rubber and Indian middle order is out of touch. Remedies should made in next match by blooding new comers and promoting the middle order batsmen, up in the batting order.

@SIRI12345 Yes, we are a good team. We not only believe it, we proved it. We didn't ask for a sixth string team! Its amazing to see Finch, Marsh, Maxwell, Watson, Faulkner in a sixth string Australian team!!

The main difference between the ODI series loss and T20 series win is the bowling options MSD had in T20s but not in ODIs. If selectors could have thought a little and provided MSD with anyone of Yuvi or Raina, ODI series result could have been reversed. MSD is gold when it comes to utilizing extra bowling options but he badly missed this thing in ODIs. I hope selectors will learn from this and will select a balanced team next time rather than running for young talent.

Yay!! Congratulations! Mr. Dhoni, I guess, after all you did it again. But I must say that you did need Yuvi's blessing as always. Now that the series has been won, I hope Mr. Dhoni will try out some of the bench strength. And I'm hoping Mr. Dhoni wins the toss and elects to bowl first, just to see how they bat with a set target. I'm really excited to see the next one. Bravo India. I'm so proud right now, it's border line  boastful for being an Indian.

Great,great,great series victory for Indian team because it is in Australian soil terrific team work, Hats off to the Master Kohli avaerging above 50 in T20's uffff? as hardly any batsman in world has average close to 40.
MS works through out the match was perfect, Yuvraj bowls best overs of the match his 2 overs provide India stability,Jadeja bowls and fields well. Incredible stuff from this Indian team these 2 Victories are Equal to the upcoming T20 World cup in my eyes as we have not win any thing sufficiently in this country ever before(in terms of Bilateral series).

A big positive for Australia is the bowling of Watson who is head and shoulders above the Aussie bowlers in the T-20 series, much better than Faulkner. Australia should do well to give him preference over Faulkner in India where two pace bowling all rounders might be a luxury. Tye seems to be a decent SF bowler, better than all others except Watto and probably Hastings that Australia tried in the series (including the ODI series also). He will be a decent backup for Stark- Haz combo in the WT-20. Lack of an effective spinner and weakness of playing spin will come to haunt the Aussies though.Will be tough for  Smith to carry  the entire team alone to the podium. Has seen Usman in the big bash and he deserves a chance in WT20. A batsman with subcontinental roots (read supple wrists) will always be more effective against sub continental spinners in the turf than a thoroughbred Aussie like Flinch or Lynn. My squad Warner, Finch, Watson, Smith, Usman, Maxi, Wade, Stark, Haz, Tye and Lyon.

No starc, Johnson retired, no Hazelwood, no Pattinson, no Cummins, no Bailey, haddin should have been picked over Wade, Smith n Warner rested,no Mitchell Marsh, khwaja not selected, dunno y...... ..... It's hilarious......

Well done India!!! I remember before India landed there was lot of hate comments
from fans saying India will be whitewashed. Well learn to respect our team. We
dont deny that our pace bowling is not the best in the world. Also there is always
the FTB word going around. Indians have scored many, many 100's in all parts of
the world.

This positive wave of newbies is just a pattern of mist. The Most important thing is how this team progress with different competitors. Honestly, Ind is a decent side in one day or a short t20 formats. But as a test playing nation, this luxury team need some real good wicket producing bowlers. Can Bumrah bowl in tests?? Maybe not. His peculiar action may not help him for long formats as he get tires quickly.

'Dropped' isn't quite the right terminology given the juggling going in and out is it really?
Tye and to a lesser extent Boland showed they could be useful in India and to me it seems that Lyon should be kept for Tests.
I think Zampa is the more likely WC selection and perhaps they are keeping him from these games as someone already picked.
I assume the experienced Watson would captain in Sydney with Finch out.
The best use of that match is to test borderline selections. Someone like Lynn hasn't taken his chance and may get one more.
The alternative keeper Bancroft is also a good idea.

This is to some aussies: When will your 1st string will play cricket? may be in 2020? Whenever you lose a game, you come up with many strings a-z. Would you agree if other teams say the same when we lost games against aussies all these years? Next excuse is we are not interested in T20 format. Your team management could have said this to BCCI before even agreed to this tour. Unarguably, Australia have been the best side in Test and ODI cricket for many years. But, when some of your fans will learn to appreciate and respect other oppositions when they play well? If you remain unbeaten and unchallenged all the time, then no sense in playing with other teams. This is to some of our Indian fans and Aussie fans, please write something constructive rather than insulting the opposition all the time. Be fair and realistic in your reviews rather than just fighting all the time. Thank you. Hope cricinfo will publish this.

So based on a few t20 slogs that ended in hands of outfielders-against basically spinners bowling darts-our spinners Ashwin,Jad are 'best in the world'. The same bowlers who got absolutely hammered in the odis,1 of them not to be seen after 1st 2 games!

Well, this whole policy of Aussie selectors 'resting' players and playing other players who are just not good enough is outright baffling and is also robbing the paying fans of the chance to see the best set of players in action. What is more baffling is that they don't pick Usman Khwaja and give a whole heap of other players a chance in this series. And this argument by the Aussie fans that they are not playing their best XI.....well, nobody is stopping you from doing that. Ultimately a series loss is a series loss.

More care needs to be take of the players as it is only hurting the game when their workload is to much and are forced to rest from games.

Good show by Spinners again. Bowled with heavy dewy ball with absolutely no turn from the pitch and still Aus batters can't hit. Make no mistake, this is not a "3rd string" batting lineup from Aus. Finch, Marsh, Lynn, Maxie, Faulkner are all top class T20 batsmen and have been picked up on the basis of their performances in BBL. Only one missing is Warner, Smith anyway focusses on commentary than cricket.  NO excuses for Aus posters this time. Wish the aus posters here were at MCG to make some noise and outnumber Indian fans there. Haha.

Congrats to the Indian team on the series win. Even at full strength Aussies would have had a tough series. Interesting to see for how long Finch is out with that hamstring. I'd say he'll be ok for the world cup, but definitely he won't be in NZ. A chance for Khawaja?

Jadeja should be the man of the match. On this wet field bowling second Jadeja bowled beautifully. He is extraordinary in field too and took crucial three wickets including run out. Two catches and one stumping was also dropped off his bowling. Jadeja must be the man of the match as the pitches are offering nothing for spinners and fields are quite wet.

Congrats India too good again. Don't agree with most of you here saying India didn't get enough runs and those blaming Aussie bats. Reckon India scored plenty. 180 batting first in Australia will win most games. How good was Jadejas catch off Watson.  What was Wade thinking? Lynn went big too early but he is still a good player. Batsmen &amp; spinners won it for India.

This Aussie side will have 8 different players come WT20! Cricket Australia need to stop insulting paying supporters as well as touring sides and select full strength teams. If India were to ever lose to this side they should give it away.

I remember Finch talking about 8-0-50-4 against the spinners last match. Well it has become 10-0-66-4 today. A slight improvement, I will say. Jokes apart, the only difference between the two teams in SF cricket is Australia's strong lower middle order  compared to the long tail of the Indian side and the running between the wicket. This factor held back the Indian batters throughout the ODI series, and Australia won the third match due to it's strong lower middle order batting (Maxi - Faulkner partnership).  In T-20 both of these advantages are somewhere negated and hence the result. Also Indian spinners are slowly finding their groove back which  handed over the advantage to Australia.

Marsh &amp; Wade have to go never to return. Khawaja and Paine in.   How Khawaja cannot get in this team in his current form is a disgrace. Australia badly lacking any wicket taking bowlers and Lyon should never play any limited overs cricket again for Aus.  Aus just cannot play good cricket against any half decent spin bowling.   Don't see anything changing at all.  Big problem!

India have Pakistan, NZ and Australia in their group. It will still be tough and this score was defendable because of large boundaries. 180 can be chased in India, but if the pitches offer any turn, then all the sub-continent teams are in with a chance. All the others better pray the pitches are roads, because that's the only way they'll avoid humiliation. Expect India, Pak, SL and Bang to be in the semis.

Even Yuvraj bowled superb, turned the game, he can be also man of the match. or MSD played superb role and did super tactics, stumpings, run outs, handy runs, can be Man of the match. Runs are good to have and easy to make, but wickets were important. so Rohit or Kohli should not be given man of the match.

Today we learned that one simple thing can destroy australia. Spinner to spin the ball a little, i repeat it "a little" now the fact that wc is in india, ball is going to spin a mile, so dear australian fans practice this words "eh, who cares its just a t20 not test or odi. We dont care for such formats"

Jadeja should be given man of the match. The way he bowled, grabbed two imp wicket. one great run out and one wicket goes down due to drop catch by dhawan! Jadeja have 3 wickets, 1 run out, great fielding, clear man of the match today!

Kholi  is a world class player. All of his shots are beautifully manufactured and completely orthodox. He plays risk free cricket even in a T20 format. Dependable more than any one else. A true legend. What more do Indians want from him???

One thing is clear from this series that Australian batsmen can not survive against quality spin bowling. Will be surprised if they reach knockout of World T20 which is held in India. Tough time ahead of over rated Australian team.

Great performance by India. Probably the team they should have played with in the ODI's. Energetic, young and attacking bowlers, good variations. Kohli ofcourse a treat to watch. They missed the trick in ODI's i.e. Spin but a great fightback in T20's.

Australia need Khawaja now - World T20 is too far away - batting looks really unbalanced with out him - reminds me of the Australian Test team with Watson batting at 3. Selectors kept saying Watson was batting at number 3 because there was no one with class to replace him. They have a class batsmen who will suit the Indian bowling and the current conditions because he plays a lot like there classier batsmen. Well what is their excuse now?

People again blaming Virat Kohli for this score�you ppl have lost your minds�guy scores a 50 at a strike rate of 175.00 - is this not enough that you expect him to score at 300. The reason india has managed these scores  is because of consistent batting of Kohli� The guy in Pak is getting jailed for being a Virat fan and indians put him in such negative picture

Kohli is becoming selfish day by day. He didn't go for the second because that was the last ball of the over but in the next over he went for the two when he played exact shot, so that he can be on strike. He played at a very good strike rate but still, he is being selfish even didnt go for the second in last ball of the innings not to hurt his average. Its really unbecoming of kohliz

India scored 184 where easy chance missed to make 200 again!! You do not want to see Kohli or Rohit makes their 50s and stay till the end!! These two batsman playing good but missing the trick how to play in final overs!! Kohli getting singles and twos in final two overs, are you kindding?? No matter how big he scored himself makes team india in trouble again!! Specially Yuvraj, Raina, Pandya sitting in dougout and kohli wasted important deliveries, more imp he did not give enough strike to MSD!! Rohit you can feel doing all short of drama, not playing with full throttle, the way he stretch himself with Mumbai Indians team!! 200 + score can be achievable and Kohli and Rohit and Shikhar are you just an odi players??? Not learning anything from MSD. or trio is not learning from youngsters!!!!Very bad cricket by Kohli, Rohit!!!!!

Not sure if this is a typo, but he made his T20I debut against Sri Lanka in 2010.

<p>
Hastings has played 3t20i's before tonight, the three debutants are lyon, tye and BOLAND.

Experiment is one thing which indians do not know and they are known for going back to expired shelf life cricketers. Can they learn from aussies to test their bench strength or next in line cricketers to see their potentials and to groom them for near future. If we see in tests, ODI's and T20's too they tried many new guys without bothering about the results, the result is they found a few guys who can be inducted into the national side any time but thats not the case with india, the fear of failure bothers them a lot, when we are failing with tested ones why not try new guns and who knows you may unearth a few raw diamonds who can be polished but no they would never ever take that risk for fear of failing and above all losing the viewership and money associated with that. For BCCI it is money over everything else, what a sick mentality. 1.5 bn population can produce neither worthy 15 fast bowlers nor spinners. what a pitiable situation.

Personal targets achievement seem to be of more importance than the team. As I said ,if set batsmen can not push up scoring,especially when the pitch is flat, the team suffers. Let Rohit make a ton in each match and Kohli a fifty, but in this match India could not have crossed 300 but for Rahane upping the ante a bit. Bowlers have let down India and blaming Dhoni is silly. 
Hope at MCG the Indians chase, let us see.

all this talk about 300s being chased, rohits dot balls etc. but no mention of bowling on such dead wickets. yes india lost 8 wickets but dhawan threw his wicket away, and india's 2 main batsmen were run out and the rest fell going for 6s (or were tailenders). so just remember that even aussie bowlers have struggled on BOTH pitches and they are HOME bowlers. but india do have a problem with their attack especially when there's nothing in it for the spinners!

Well normally I would not support India but it is Australia, so I feel sorry for the effort Sharma and all put in. India needs to get all the Aussies 10 batsmen out, otherwise there is no stopping them. 
Good Luck in the next three games India.

Last time India visited Australia, the situation compelled Dhoni to retire from test cricket. Now it's like he may quit ODIs. He has to be blamed for not adding fast runs at a strike rate of 200%. Kohli's keeping his fingers crossed.

Luck ashwood@ I totally agree with you yes batsman job to score runs but according to the situation Rohit Sharma face lots ball to score century in todays cricket on flat pitches u don't need that many balls to score centuries I agree if pitch was difficult u should take extra balls but in flat pitches as a batsman u don't need to west valuable balls rohit Sharma need to change his mind set at the moment he plays to conservative cricket don't take any risk Australia bating line up is very strong India should target at least 330 to give challenge to Australia that's why Dhoni says Indian batsman need to play freely at the moment Rohit Sharma play to slowly yes he score centuries but India lose the match...

Can't believe some fans criticizing Kohli and even Rohit for their strike rates. They scored runs at decent rates after losing Dhawan early each time. Look at Finch and Marsh yesterday. Both had strike rates in the mid ops. That's normal for people trying to build an innings. You can't ask a batsman to hold the innings together like Rohit has and still score at astronomical rates. Its the lower middle order that has failed to accelerate effectively. But to be honest 310 should be a defendable score. Indian bowlers need to have very specific plans. And the catching needs to improve as well.

Rohit should have walked. Not that it was going to make any difference to the end result. India I lacking someone who can come in 40th over and score a quick 30 or 40 runs in 10 or so balls. I think Dhoni Is quite capable of doing that but he is past his prime. Anyway it was still an interesting contest. Good luck to both teams at MCG.

@TendulkarDrives I don't know if sacking Dhoni is the answer to India's current malaise.  This is not an individual sport.  At the end of the day, a Captain - while the buck does stop with him - can only do so much.  Our batsmen need to play to reach a specific target rather than reach a personal milestone.  Our bowlers need to learn to put the ball in the right places - which they did once every blue moon - and our fielders need to make the most of even those half-chances.  I found great delight in a shrewd observation made by a fan from Pakistan (featured on this thread) who suggested that India by and large has been favoring a 'batting culture.'  He is right!  IPL does not favor bowlers.  T20s are created to appease 'hit-hungry' savages who care nothing for finesse or timing just monster bats with gigantic edges, short boundaries, flat tracks and brute power.  Bowlers are not bowling to take wickets.  They are too busy trying not to look stupid before millions.  God help us.

Its being discussed everywhere that India lost the game because of bad bowling.  That isnt true if you really analyze the way thing go with the Indian team.  Firstly we have players struggling at the top.  Shikar Dhawan has been consistently failing and not sure how he finds a place at the top every time.  Second look at Dhoni's contribution.  Its basically that he has lost touch with his batting and gone are the helicopter shots.  If people think that Indian bowlers were thrashed, so were Aussie bowlers.  The difference was the way we batted and the way they batted.   Things slow down for Rohit to complete his century.  That's the mind set we have.  Cos we recognize only the three digit score and ignore the rest.  Its time Dhoni steps out and hands over the gloves to an younger budding player who can also strike the ball.    Most importantly, the team needs to gear up to play the last 10 overs.  At a minimum 100 runs are expected.

Nothing  to discuss about this match except one faulty decision by umpire which went in favour of Rohit. To my surprise, no one is talking about that Rohit should have walked when he nicked caught behind on 89 like one day before Bailly was given advice by fans. Further, none is talking about DRS. Nice tolerance.

When Indian spinners were bamboozling the South Africans with balls that were turning square on pitches tailor-made for the spinners, indignant cricketers outrageously suggested that the South Africans did not know how to craft their stay at the wicket and were severely lacking in patience and application.  To a certain extent that was true.  However, only an utterly biased fan would insist the pitches had nothing to do with it.  Ashwin and Jadeja were praised to no end.  Well, now all that has come back to bite the Indians in their entitled behinds.  While not all Indians are overcome by blind devotion to a bunch of over-paid, over-hyped Indian cricketing team, some do tend to make rather silly remarks.  For instance Bailey's refusal to walk.  Well, as another person pointed out here, I don't see any Indian fan holding Rohit Sharma accountable to the same principle.  But, God forbid, anyone playing against them refuse to walk...one would not hear the end of it.  Sigh!

I don't get why Australia is winning so easily. They are resting Starc (the world's No. 1 ranked ODI bowler) also resting Patterson. Now they are resting Hazelwood till the NZ test..and Siddle is injured. 
I'm available to bowl a few overs if they need me.

I have to agree (totally) on your observation about the field setting for Ashwin by his captain. But I will partly blame Ashwin also for that, since Ashwin is one of the intelligent guys, whose opinions (and requests) are by and large, valued by Dhoni. I saw only very minor tinkering, Ashwin was doing with the fielders, set by Dhoni.
</p>
<p>
Ashwin is  smart. I feel he will come up with some ways of making an impact even in these conditions. Hopefully.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I don't think, he is the type who would follow anyone's instructions. (forget mine). I noticed once even from Prasanna. of course offered through the media, as none approached Prasanna for help or advice. Prasanna got the same response from Bhajji too during Bhajji's decline.
</p>
<p>
I am not making this point as a criticism; but as a sign of his 'supreme confidence'. It is that which may help him to concoct some new ways to cope with the current impasse in the results for his efforts.

@crrkiran - i disagree with you about the job of a batsman and bowler. Their jobs aren't just to get runs / wickets, its how economically they get them. If a batsman consistantly scores 100 in 200 balls, the team will lose every time. So to a bowler taking 5 for 150.

Question for Indian fans: Do you think it is right for India to display 3 stars above their logo in their playing shirts? They represent World Cup victories. Yet India have won only 2 ODI World Cups. The 3rd represents T20I World cup.  The two are different formats with the latter requiring a higher proportion of luck. Shouldn't there only be 2 stars to truely represent the facts, rather than bignoting themselves. If my team did that, I'd be a bit embarressed.

@Drew12 very interesting stats by any chance could you compare those stats to when they didn't score a century so that you actually know the true impact of the player?

Your point about getting more revs from the fingers is absolutely right.  
</p>
<p>
Swann achieved that more than the Indian spinners, when England beat India in India. The pressure put on India by Swann also helped Panesar to reap rewards on that tour.

Carlwhyte  our under 19 team will do better than this team mate. But Honestly weren't the Aussies thrashed 0-4 in the last test  series played in India and lost the series 3-4 with Rohit carting the Aussie bowlers all over the park. Honestly Indian bowling is not spectacular but nor is Aussie bowling except Faukner. Having a non performing Dhoni at No6 is hurting India.

Until or unless, Indian batsmen play for their country and bat Australia out, they don't have a chance. Australia is not challenged by 350. These CORPORATE ODI PITCHES, require 375+ score to be on a safer side. Remember England Vs NZ few months ago 400 was made and match was won by 40 odd  runs. These CROWD PULLING SURFACES have nothing to offer for bowlers, and Indian bowlers don't have special skills and consistent pace. ICC has decided to make ODIs look like extended versions of T20s.

Simple theory (Simple Mathematics):
T20 - 240 balls/20wickets - Avg. balls/wicket - 12
ODI - 600 balls/20wickets - Avg. balls/wicket - 30
Test - 2700balls (90*5*6)/40wickets - Avg. balls/wicket - 67.5
</p>
<p>
So in order to bat long one obviously hav to hav temperaement to endure that. This is now missing from modern players as various T20 leagues are easy money with less class/temperament &amp; only hitting. The thing is that in order to change the trend ICC need to outgrow this T20 era and put players first. Prepare pitches that is sporty and not flat placid (chasing 300 is child's play now). There are players who irrespective of class &amp; temperament not acknowledged, why?? Just the case is that money rules over passion nowadays in all fields.

There was a lot of hue and cry after the last ODI about Bailey being given not out. People said that he should have walked, India would have won if he had been given out, Dhoni wanting to push umpires to make right decisions. Now that the exact same thing happened to Rohit Sharma, everyone is suddenly quiet on that matter??????

Drop ishant, shikhar dhawan and jadeja, get in Gurkeerat, dhawan and mohit or any other fast bowler. Manish pandey can open with Rohit!!!  Its last 15 overs while batting and middle overs while bowling costing india the match! Reason is Jadeja and ishant is just not good enough!!

Rohit Sharma: Lost 50%. India losing more than 1/4 matches in which Tendulkar scores more than 100 is an extremely high amount... but pales in comparison to Sharma of course.

Drop catches and wides made the differences between the two teams. These people are bowling too many wides just like a park cricket. Why the hell you want to be an international player when you can't control the swing and bowl too many wides. Ridiculous spinners bowled many short balls to give easy boundaries. India scored hard fought 300 whereas Australia scored it very ease because of the crap bowling by the Indian unit

"Ashwin is as good if not better than Lyon anyday" Lyon out bowled Ashwin during the last tour. Ashwin has never done well away from India. Look at his average. He needs those rank turners. Average bowler with limited talent.

well said cricket lover. India gave a threat by posting 300+ which no international team would have done. rohit was slow even after scoring century his next 20 balls should have fetched 30 to 40 runs which could have been competitive. dropped catches: india lost it, Australia did not get that win. self destruction in death overs and fielding efforts.

Ashwin's caliber is exposed and Mr Ishant is more concerned with issue of his hair style whether to tie them or let them loose. Kumar is for me a world class material and Shami too. Kumar should be given confidence. And one more thing, both Kohli and Rohit CAN NOT afford to play with same strike rate. One has to sacrifice the big score and play for team with a strike rate of at least 150 on this belter. I mean, come on Rohit and Kohli, look at Australian attack, boland, Paris and Faulkner, they are starting their carriers, you could have tore them apart at 10 runs an over. And you are grafting for tons. This is not team game. South Africa thumped 438, FOUR HUNDRED + NOT 308  or even 330, on a similar pitch, which is called  CORPORATE ODI PITCH.

I don't get it. India has toured Australia the most among Asian teams in recent years. They should have fair idea about how to adapt and play on these conditions by now. Forget about the batsmen, bowlers especially the likes of Yadav, Ashwin, Jadeja should be more competent. They are completely different when they play in India compared to other places. You can tell from their body language, they have little self-belief. Instead of making excuses, Indian fans should be worried why their team is getting treated like a club side.

Never mind,lost the matches though,but India has enough to celebrate.i.e.Centuries of Rohit,bowling of a new bowler Sern,ever consistant Kohli and a lot more.To achieve victory against Ausralia ourside India is out of possibility.So carry on India fans with hero worship

There's an excellent article by Sid Monga that explains a lot. The reason India have lost these games isn't the batting or the bowling or the fielding. It's all three. None of them are by huge margins but the cumulative effect is significant. For example, he says one of the small things, but a big difference, is the throwing arms of the bowlers. Oz were taking 2's where there were singles for the Indians because the Indians haven't got good throwing arms. .. Over the course of the innings there could have been 30-40 extra runs taken just on the arm alone.

No Starc, no Johnson, no Hazelwood, no Siddle, no Pattinson, no M Marsh, no Warner, and yet, India loses against Australia B team (in terms of bowling). Let's admit at least now: unless India can produce quality fast bowlers, India cannot even dream of putting up a contest outside of sub-continent.

Rohit and Kohli seems more intent on playing for personal records than for India. The fact that Rahane (considered to be the least aggressive than the other top 5-6 batsman) had a higher strike rate than either Rohit or Kohli is saying quite a bit. Rohit seems to only perform well on very flat surfaces. Kohli usually is a bit more aggressive on these flatter surfaces, but he is desperately looking for those ODI centuries that he once used to get every other match.

Dhoni is a legend and a great batsman but i do agree he is not a good captain. Watching a total like 309 disappear so easily with no pressure on the batsmen hurt me. For heavens sake, PLEASE dont give up easy singles in the field, just because you can have 5 men out doesnt mean you have to. Mahendra, if the bowlers want the field back then you need to tell them not to, to apply pressure and if you want the fieldsmen back, dont. Id much rather see ***4*4 in an over than 111*22 with no pressure.

ACricLover i agree with part of your analysis and disagree in parts you said ishant yadav didnt bowl ofcourse they bowled badly ishant after bowling for so many years still cant get his line and length right yadav with his pace is highly eratic if they bowl proper line and length i'd agree with your point with regard to batting rohit kholi and rahane to a certain extent have batted well oz rested its main string bowlers who could have exploited indian top order weakness  home advantage yes but dismissing the glaring facts are wrong

Team wins, then what a great captaincy! team loses then what an ordinary bowling, what an ordinary batting (in spite of 300+ runs in 2 consecutive matches) which almost no visiting team achieves in australia. 
</p>
<p>
By the bye this pace bowling unit of india is quite good, i have been watching cricket for few decades and i have not seen any other touring team bowlers doing anything better than this indian bowling unit in australia. It was not ishant or yadav or sran were bowling bad, rather it was australian batsmen who were batting good and also home pitch advantage. I am telling home pitch advantage because the way australian batsmen struggle in subcontinent, the way they lost all matches in the t20 world  cup in bangladesh, anyway these are the home games and they have the upper hand. 
</p>
<p>
I am still unable to see what is wrong with indian pacers, england could not defeat bangladesh and could not reach quarterfinal in WC, and SA too struggled in australia in WC.

Traditionally , Australia always had a factory of fast bowlers that suits their wickets . Almost all of them can bowl at 140+ KMPH. Further their bowlers are no muck with the bat . This is not the case with India. Even Lyon , with all his experience of bowling in Australia would have struggled to control the batsmen on featherbeds prepared for the ODIs. That's why Australia does not include Lyon in the ODIs. Make no mistake,Ashwin is as good if not better than Lyon anyday . India has limited fast bowling resources and one cannot help laughing when Ishant is considered the leader of the attack . Even after playing almost 70 tests and 80 onedayers , Ishant is yet to learn to avoid no balls and wides . In both matches , the pacers could have done much better . It is entirely upto Indian batsmen to post totals of 350 runs and hope for the pacers to bowl with control , if they don't want to lose the series 5-0 .

It is ironic couple of players are singled out for criticism .  Have the other bowlers performed in the same expectation. Batting at no. 6 or later ifs also very difficult in one day matches.   Hardly.  So this indicates  some kind of dislike according to the taste of writers.

Congrats Australia. Another commanding performance against this hapless Indian team! Pathetic display from these Indians, who only seem to glory in personal milestones, never mind the team winning...what a ridiculous mentality; unfortunately, it seems like it's always been like this, sadly, in the Indian mindset. The team is what matters. Sadly, the bowling is simply not up to the mark in foreign conditions. As I've said before, there's no point being a lion at home and a lamb overseas, as has been the long and sad tradition of Indian teams playing abroad...no other team in the World seems as poor travellers, still, as the Indian Team!! It looks like there's only going to be one result here, perhaps even a 5 - 0 drubbing for these clueless Indians...anyway, let's hope of some sort of revival in the remaining ODI's...

Wow.  500 posts.  Jadeja and to a lesser extent, Ashwin, will always struggle in Australia, because they have good spin on turning pitches, but not the same command of pace, bounce and flight, that Lyon has cultivated here. To be the complete package they need that.  Ashwin will, but Jadeja does not seem any threat to anyone in Australia with bat or ball.

India needs to take leaf out of pakstan bowling attack. With bowling you can win matches even if batsmen underform but not the otherway round as india have to realise. India need the likes of zaheer khan.

India scoring 300 plus in 2 matches against a second string Australian bowling line up and still losing. India has lost it's way and need change. A start will be to have a new leader. The ideas and thoughts are old. The team has been consistent in it's performance with losses in the tri series last year in Aus, loss in the WC semi final, losing against Bangladesh and SAF a this performance. Not sure what more evidence and stats one needs to move forward.

Indian batsmen are too personal milestone driven, 2 wickets down at 40 over mark and two established batsmen at the crease, still dabbing and pushing going less than a-run-a-ball to make a big hundred. Australia might have scored over 350 if they were at similar situation batting first on those pitches.

Totally gutless performance from India ... They had the opportunity to score 330 but just trundled along in the middle overs thinking they were doing well to score 300... 350 is the new 300 India. And as for DRS, you either walk or have DRS, not doing both is embarrassing you. And you therefore deserved to lose (notwithstanding pathetic fielding). An all round shambles. And time to move on from dhoni. Still cannot win away.

India have toured Australia number of times in recent years now. Pity, they are still still useless and incapable of competing here. Aswin, jedja all look out of their depth

Not a fan off Rohit, feel he has way too much luck on his side, his two back to back centuries may sound epic but they were on easy wicket against a B rated, novice and  toothless Aussie bowlers,  so Rohit still remains a flat track bully and not a match winner. I agree with many of the folks who are asking for Dhawan to be dropped, he is a liability, will be better if Kohli or Rahane can open with Rohit. Also Jaedja is not effective outside of India but we have to tolerate him as long as MSD is Captain.  Shame on BCCI for their inability to produce fast bowlers. Even a bottom team like Pak has better bowlers than Ind.

Joel Paris had a good game. Only 1 wkt but the best economy rate of any bowler in the match at 5 rpo. He also bowled 23 dots in his 49 deliveries and conceded only 2 boundaries and no sixes. .. It's slipped under the radar a bit, but that's a very good performance for a young man in only his second game. It's even better when you factor in the trueness of the pitch and the quality of the batsmen he was up against. Well done young fella. That was a low key but important and accomplished effort. One of the few standout bowler performances in the match.

Again we should ask what our bowling coach, tacticians, strategists n team mgmt. are doing.. as public we continue to see the same mistakes in bowling dept, running between wkts, cannot rotate strike, cannot accelerate even when situation is favorable, fielders allowing 2s in place of singles, 3s in place of 2s and vice versa when we bat... bowling innocuous short deliveries at 130 kmph and then fetching the ball from outside the boundary... n continuing to do so... 5th or 6th ball is invariably a boundary ball... when will we analyse and rectify... when will we end the 'process' and start winning.. when experienced legendary bowlers say they are still learning, they are indicating they are learning new things.. NOT BASICS.. when will we get our basics right.. yes I am talking of Ishant, Yadav, Jadeja,  etc etc etc.. Hoping for the best..

its the same story.. public will say rishi shud play instead of jadeja.. till rishi start playing.. all these players are same class.. that means below international std.. their names get glorified till they start to play intl matches.. if we bat first nothing under 350 is a safe score.. given our weak bowling and aus batting which goes down to Faulkner and wade.. if we bat second, chasing 300+ wud be a daunting task, given that virtually no batting exists after No 5. if Aus bat 1st, they wud surely score 350 . we will preserve wkts till rate becomes 8/ovr and the story will repeat. Have been an ardent fan of MSD, but feel he shud bow out gracefully. His team makes him look stupid and helpless. His batting skills have waned that he looks like an old Lion king who cant hunt. Public shud know this is the best 11 we have.. rishi dhawan or Karun nair or any other name we take are only as good (or bad) as those in the XI. they will be held in high esteem till they start playing. good luck.

@Streetblader but India have so few away victories. Many of those games they won were at home. And recently they lost an ODI series at home. It doesn't matter how many centuries one player scores. If the bowlers cannot take wickets you are in trouble. India fans spoke about their team's domination when they win at home in dust bowls made for Ashwin. The second India leaves home they cannot even buy a victory. It is a sign that their reliance on spin and poor pitches is hampering their development.

Unless bowlers, especially seamers, are given more incentives than batsmen this is bound to happen. People try to avoid bowling instead pickup bat because batting is less work comparatively, less prone to injuries, have more career lifespan, gets more recognition, more ad revenue, etc. Imagine bowling in humid/hot conditions bowling at 140+ speed throughout day(tests). No idea if there are any rules regarding ground dimensions, few grounds are just 55m, no one likes getting hit all over the park. Indian pitches/grounds are pathetic. Hardly there are 2-3 grounds suitable for seam bowlers. If primary importance is to entertain people then yes introduce a rule not allowing bowlers to bowl more than 140+!!! :)
</p>
<p>
To make world class fast bowlers 1) Make more seam friendly pitches 2) Increase salary/incentives for fast bowlers 3) Make mandatory rest for 3-4 months a year 4) Hire best bowling coaches at domestic level 5) Rotate bowlers in test matches.

@ Jose_P: I didn't actually see any of this game because my TV antenna got blown away in a storm. I'd just like to say that it's not easy bowling off spin down here though. Many have tried but most have failed. As you said, flight drift and dip are the best weapons here but it takes a lot of revs to achieve that. If you want to be an attacking spinner you have to really spin it, hard. The ball does spin and move around in the air but hardly ever extravagantly so it all adds up to a lot of hard work. .. The last foreign player to have genuine success here was Graeme Swann as far as I can recall. His 2nd last tour was a good one for him because he was really giving the ball a rip and beating batsmen in the air, getting them out of position and then getting enough spin to beat the bat. .. I'm not sure how big a tweak Ashwin gives it these days but if he is giving it a rip and his lines are good as well as his fields he should pick up some wickets eventually.

To be honest I didn't think Australia were anywhere near top form and were scratchy with bat and ball.
But they still won fairly comfortably without Warner, Starc, Cummins, Pattinson , M Marsh &amp; Lyon having also retired Clarke, Johnson, Haddin &amp; probably Watson from the World Cup win.

every player is a given a specific job. A batsman job is to go out there a probably get a century . A bowlers job is to go out there and get a 4 or 5 wicket haul. When batsman does his job and bowler doesnt, how can u call batsman selfish?

It is amusing to note that most of the comments here from Indian fans focus on solutions like changing the batter order, dropping Dhoni etc. while the real reason for these two defeats is India's chronic problem with bowling. I am from Pakistan but I bear no ill will towards India (or any other country for that matter); but I really feel India has developed too much of a batting culture over decades, which is now letting them down AWAY FROM HOME. Just as Pakistan's problems lie in batting, India's lie in bowling. Just as it's disheartening for Pakistan bowlers to find their batsmen struggling to chase even modest totals OR posting modest totals to defend, it must be disheartening for India's batsmen to keep on posting 300 scores only to find their bowlers unable to defend. And no, 300 is still not an easily gettable total! The pressure of chasing is different and a good bowling side should be able to use that pressure to their advantage.

the problem with india is they dont have any big hitters for the end overs , like yuvraj or pathan! they rely on jadeja or ashwin who are bowling all rounders who bat well one in 7-8 innings!

Why don't India resign and leave. That way atleast they can save their face. And as Ravi Shastri said, results don't matter only process matters. And your process is not working sir. And what is Manish Pandey doing in the team. His first class average is 34 odd, and there are so many other players. If Yuvraj was given so many chances like Dhawan got, he would have been back to form easily. Politics is what killing the Indian cricket.

4 posts down before tendulkar get mentioned. Must be a record. For what it is worth.pitches are flat so indians can bat mechanically. Bowling is poor. Ashwin looks useless away from home pitches. These matches are dull.if it wasnt for an unfortunate bout of bowel surgery recently I could have got up to turn the tv off.so we know what we always have. Aus look good at home and india only win on beaches

India should start building team with allrounders as they are never gonna produce the bowlers who can win match on their own.
Likes of ishant,Umesh ,Bhuvi are all very ordinary bowlers like Irfan Pathan but irfan still better batsmen than them so should be drafted in the ODI side at least and also Nehra should be considered too and as far as Jadeja is concerned he is meant for indian pitches but will flop overseas .why gurkeerat ,pandya or rishi not given atleast a series each respectively so test their ability.Rishi will be again be ordinary bowler though.

I would say it's Rohit Sharma's fault. I mean, what a careless way to get out. And only scoring 124 at a strike rate of 97. That's rubbish. Geoff Boycott's auntie could do better than that on those pitches. Give him one more chance and if he doesn't score 300 then drop him.

Worthless bowling by Indians. Ashwin has proved again his quality! Only can show off in own soil. A good bowler is capable of doing the job at any places regardless of the pitch or the ground. Look at the economy rate of his bowling in first two odis! Pitches should be altered for Ashwin for the remaining matches to suit him!!!

You can't blame Indians batsmen for being "30 runs short" when Bailey and Maxwell saved atleast that amount with their superb fielding. It's the huge gulf between both teams' pace attacks that has proven the difference twice now, and that is with Australia missing their ENTIRE frontline pace attack.

Australia and India are the deserved number 1 and 3 in ODI cricket but Australia has just been better than the rest in this format for a long, long time. Now I'm still waiting for us to regain our test supremacy, going on 9 years now For us Aussies...

It's absolutely ridiculous that some folks here keep dissing Rohit when he's batting so well and getting the 100s while the other batsmen and bowlers are not pulling their weight in the team. A lot of us are disappointed with the way India has been playing of late barring a few exceptional performances from Rohit, Virat and to a lesser extent - Ashwin (on Indian pitches). The rest doesn't really have the right skills to play at this level or aren't being utilized by the team management properly which in either case is very very disappointing from an Indian fan's perspective. Not good for cricket in the country and all across the world in the longer run.

Australia has chased down two 300 plus scores by running singles and twos, and without yet having to resort to hitting big. India's conservative play has allowed them to do that. That's not to say they haven't worked hard for the chase, India has made them work, but if they get to bat first in this series, we will see exactly how they unleash the lower order hitters to build an massive score. Nevertheless India has batted well,  just need to take a few more risks in the middle overs.

I'd expected Hazelwood to be rested after 2nd ODI. But, AUS selectors &amp; team management have become bolder after d Perth ODI. Warner &amp; M Marsh are set to return at MCG in place of S Marsh &amp; Hastings. I hope dey drop Finch for d remaining ODIs &amp; retain S Marsh or pick Khwaja for Finch. The bowling looks very thin. Both Paris &amp; Boland have failed to create any pressure &amp; bowled on d batsmen's pads regularly. Behrendorff for Paris &amp; Hilfenhaus for Boland will be perfect.

The problem is the bowling. We had another match today,Pak vs NZ. If anyone noticed,NZ thrashed Sri Kanka around in their last game by chasing 147 in just 10 overs! By contrast,Pakistan successfully defended 170 and they would have bowled NZ out for much cheaper had Afridi not dropped Kane Williamson in Amir's first over when he was batting in the early teens I believe,he went onto score 70. This is what good bowling can do! It can make par scores defendable.

If you keep playing the same team, you are going to get the same result. Dhoni needs to change the team combination. Replace non-performing seniors - Shikhar Dhawan, Ashwin and Jadeja with youngsters - Guru Mann, Rishi Dhawan, and a batsman. Move Manish Pandey up the batting order. What's the worst thing that can happen? You might lose? But, you are losing anyway.

Another game against India, another win. 16 homeODI wins in a row now. Which is the most ever.Test records are more memorable , Australia has won 12 test series in the Sub Continent. That's a pretty good away record. While no Nation from the Sub Continent has "Ever" won a test series in Australia . Australia has never lost a test series in South Africa either and has a pretty good ODI record against SA.

@BKS05...Raina had to slog from ball 1 in 2/5 ODIs vs SA. It's a risky game slogging from ball 1 which he has done better dan anyone in d past. Der is no replacement for him even now. Both Dhawan &amp; Raina failed in dat series but Dhawan still continues to be picked even after getting a Test series &amp; 2 more ODIs to find form. Raina has been a suspect vs short balls since he started his career but was found out in d 2010 T20 WC. But. despite his known weakness, he has managed to score quick runs in death ovrs. I'd been critical of MSD since abt a year for keeping Dhawan in d side inspite of Rahane doing well on all surfaces. Dhawan is a limited player who depends on playing surfaces &amp; loads of luck to score runs unlike Rahane. But, Rahane is no sloggers. So, Raina becomes a key player.

Aus is just superior when it comes to cricket .... Fact. Unless of coarse you lay down a pitch similar to what you see at the French open. Any other conditions Aus wins easily.

Aus is just superior when it comes to cricket .... Fact. Unless of coarse you lay down a pitch similar to what you see at the French open. Any other conditions Aus wins easily.

MSD's time may not be up as a international cricketer yet but his time is definitely up as captain of Indian Cricket Team. In fact it should have happened after WC 15. As many have mentioned on this forum he is too rigid in his team selection for all conditions but before he was quite flexible and quite adventurous and excellent at least as a limited overs captain. As a test captain he was always defensive and lacking in imagination. I had given him benefit of doubt till mid-2010 when he allowed Ajantha Mendis to score 80 odd by setting defensive fields when Mendis had come to bat on 78-7 it didn't take me too much time to make up my mind that this guy wasn't a good test captain at all.

@ BKS05...Buddy, I am no fan of MSD or Kohli. I say it as I see it &amp; never comment if I haven't watched d game. Compare d first 20 ovrs of both innings. Under overcast conditions, AUS bowlers bowled at least 3 out of 6 deliveries on d pads of RS &amp; VK. The very few times dat dey bowled outside off, RS edged &amp; wasn't given while VK edged twice dat didn't carry to 1st slip. Even Zim, BD &amp; WI bowlers know d channel to bowl to Kohli except AUS. Luckily, dey hav pulled it back in d slog ovrs in both games. In contrast, India stifled AUS for abt 20 ovrs &amp; shd hav picked 2 wickets but for d fielding dat let dem down. Ashwin &amp; Jadeja were bowling tight in their 1st spells before d lack of wickets eventually started to hurt. Altho spin is India's strength, fans need to hav realistic expectations of d spinners in AUS. Spinners rarely pick 5-ers in AUS &amp; win games.

Australia win 2 matches and gain one point on the ODI rankings and india lose 2 matches and don't lose a single point. Can someone tell me how that's possible?
The ranking system is worse than duckworth lewis

I don't understand why so many of the Indian fans are so hard on their team? Australia are the current WC champions, have played 16 consecutive victories at home &amp; ranked #1 yet India still competed well with Rohit providing a wonderful innings? From my pov, the fielding was the difference, be it catching or ground fielding. Our guys must have saved 15-20 runs more than India &amp; tight matches will show this up further so there is still plenty of interest left. The games are being played in the right spirit, both teams are trying to get something out of the series for the future.

As I have stated previously, Adal Rashid is having a phenomenal BBL and he bowls....wait for it.....leg spin.  Why is Mishra not part of the team?  Ashwin and Jadeja are amazing in the Indian dust bowls but these are Australian pitches that don't offer much to the finger spinners.   Yadav and Shikar should be dropped from the team altogether - both for obvious reasons.  Bhuvi should play instead of Ishant and Dhoni should step down as captain.  When he bats at no. 4 or 5, it always slows down the run-rate and costs India plenty of runs.  With that said, scores of 309 and 308 are not too shabby.  What is pathetic is the current Indian bowling attack.  By including Mishra, Bhuvi and removing Dhoni, Yadav, Shikar and Ishant, team India can start to rebuild.  But will this ever happen?  No, otherwise Kohli, not Dhoni, would be the captain of ODI and T20.  One can only imagine what is going through Kohli's mind when Dhoni bats, selects the team, field placements and post match comments.

India dont have bowlers and that is a fact... For a decade we have only been pleasured to find some pacer who can bowl 140s... N now we have them but they dont have line or lengths... Every other team has 1  bowler whom opponents fear.,, even bangla hav one... But truth is india never had one such bowler ever since 1980's.... Im sure after batting first n scoring 300 .,, any other captain will look at their bowlers in dressing room n say "thats a easy day for u guys".                    What wud dhoni say??? "Can u guys do it this time please".....

Well batted Rohit, Rahane, GB and New Mr Cricket Smith. What is our support staff doing. Bowling is India's only weakness. We cannot defend 400 with this skills. Umesh has got the pace, Ishant and Saran has the talent. What is the bowling coach doing. Changing the captain is not going change anything. Kohli will also suffer. Change in support staff can change mood and give us some aggression. 
Umesh and Ishant bowled well 
in WC in Australia. Why not now.

The main thing that is haunting indian cricket right now is that lack of quality finisher.MS Dhoni should gracefully exit after t20 world cup.Earlier the better .Dhoni the captain does not bring out the best from his teammates .As most of them are guys who dhoni did not  supported much compared to his favourites.Indias rise in odi cricket was mostly due to his finishing abilities .Yuvraj played  a part but much lesser than dhoni.Stats speaks for themselves if you want to check use stats guru.
But as of now dhoni doesnt play those strokes which could allow him take up time and then explode and in some time start from the word go.Now he consumes balls then have to force strokes .His natural stroke making ability is diminishing or diminished .He has been a legend .He might click in coming matches which might help him hang to his spot .And most worrying part about it is that when dhoni leaves there is no finisher who can consolidate and attack what dhoni did in his heydays .

India chased down 350+ targets couple years ago when Aus toured India.. All this shows is the Aus team is rather scared to make pitches that were better in the past. They don't have good enough batsmen to face decent bowling on *good* pitches.. hence, playing it safe by making pitches that do nothing! It's a shame what Perth become now! Neither is Aus bowling close to lethal... These two teams are pretty much neck to neck and I wouldn't read too much into the results. Hope India chase and win some. On batting friendly pitches chasing is much easier than setting targets. Bhuvi was economical and he made way to wayward Ishant. Lame lame move...

india missed a finisher today. raina would have done the job if he had played. india were on course to easily score 330 or more. rahane, pandey and jadeja lacking that fire power, india could not accelerate in the final overs.

ELECTRIC_LOCO @ Yeah we missed Gurkeerat.. all the names you mentioned got chances in Indian team. They all had a decent run.  The point is don't judge without giving an opportunity.

@streetblader, then do some research on how often it is that a batsman makes a century in odI's and ends up on the losing side (It is more common now, but in sachin's  time, it was low.)

I see a lot of comments stating India lost due to Bowling only. I dont think that is true at all. In both innings even Australia struggled to take wickets until Indian batsmen were slogging. To put things into perspective - In the first match India lost only 1 wicket in the first 40 overs , and in the second then lost only 2 in the first 40 overs. India lost a bunch only when they were slogging. Expecting Indian Bowlers to take 10 wickets when Australians could not is  a long shot.
Fact is that both pitches were easily 330+ pitches and India were in a position to reach 350 both times but blew it. That is where they lost the match. Also I genuinely believe Dhoni has a detrimental effect on Indias fast bowlers. He has lost the spark to win matches.

1.The fact is Indian bowlers have struggled bowling on flat pitches. Whether it is India (remember Mumbai ODI- SA scored 400+), Australia or any where. I believe we have good bowlers where the pitches are slightly in favor of the bowlers.
</p>
<p>
2. No power hitters. Since the loss of Yuvraj (because of loss of form, health etc) and Raina (loss of form and short ball-phobia), we don't have any lower order hitters.
</p>
<p>
3. Dhoni's negative mindset in the past few years. He was phenomenal when he started as a captain giving Joginder Sharma (2007 T20 world cup final) and new comers chances. Don't tell me Joginder was a finished product. Same with Gurkeerat and Rishi-they are not. But true leadership is in giving your average soldiers the confidence to raise your skills and game to the highest level.
</p>
<p>
4. Rahane is best utilized in the first 30 to 35 overs, hence he should open or come 1 down- no later. Else, he should be benched. 
</p>
<p>
5. Dhawan should be dropped and Rahane should open

India should play 11 genuine batsmen. They should try to post something over 500 an innings.No one can chase that total . If it is to be chased their bowlers can't stop that.

Rishi Dhawan or a 4th seamer is not going to make any difference. Indian seamers also struggled in both matches, the wickets that they picked was due to Aus batsmen's mistakes and not because of pitch. Also Rishi Dhawan lacks the batting class required to fit into top 6 of batting lineup and is no better than Jadeja for No 7. What India is really missing is a world class WRIST SPINNER bcos Warne/Macgill/Kumble have done well on Australian pitches. Swann &amp; Muralidaran have struggled in Australia so u can't blame Aswin and Jadeja. But at the same time, Ashwin/Jadeja are better bowling options for a captain than RDhawan/HPandya

It's the bowling which is letting India down. scoring 30 more runs wouldn't have been a big difference.  If the bowling cannot defend 309 and make a walk in the park for the opposing batters scoring 330 wouldn't have been much of a difference. India seriously need to take wickets or find ways to do so. The bowlers are just not bowling consistent line. They will rarely win matches. I dnt think batting will always score big runs.

It's unfortunate India lost again. There are some things that should be done in 3rd ODI @MCG. One of them is, drop Dhawan permanently from ODIs. He's of no use. Promote Rahane to open with Rohit and play some hitters at 5/6 until Raina makes his way back. I don't know when will Mr. Yadav learn to bowl. India sadly misses Sami.

So Rohit is the next Sachin! In that every time he score a century India lose. Now really? Seriously? Sachin Tendulkar has scored 49 century in one day matches and India has 33 wins, 1 tie, 14 defeats and 1 no result. Just 14 defeats where he scored a century. In test matches, Tendulkar has 51 test centuries (in either innings) and 20 times India recorded victory while 20 other times match ended up as draw, leaving us with 11 defeats. Grow up guys, really.. understand this game of cricket first before hopping on making baseless comments that eventually make you look stupid.

The simplest of solution I guess is to drop Dhoni. Its been quite a while he has contributed and the game is about our national pride and not about some individual. Drop Dhoni and make Manish Pandey the keeper. He should keep equal to what Dhoni did when he first came in. And then drop Dhawan and promote Rahane at the top. You can now accomodate two hitters in the squad. And theres also one spin option still to tweak with, if needed.
This may not be ideal but at least we can try rather than losing game after game with such inevitability.

Dhoni is a great captain, probably all time best in India. Having said that, he has been too rigid in his approach off late. He has certain affinity with pace and plays bowlers who bowls around 140. Although, all these "fast" bowlers, Umesh and Ishant, have been unsuccessful for a very long time now. They have been thrashed all around the park even in the first two games. I dont understand why he doesnt play Bhuvi regularly and by dropping him every other game he is almost pushing him to bowl just fast and sacrificing on his natural ability to swing. Bhuvi did a good job in the first game (Econ 4.66) but he was dropped. I understand that as a leader sometime you have to back yourself to take decisions on your gut or instincts. But if your instincts fails you consistently you should look at some stats and take data driven decisions.

my dear Dhawan, we are all happy in the past months back  when you made  your bat to sing.  Now time has come for you to act positively i.e., you inform selectors and captain that should go back to get trained under a good coach since your captain is very delicate to act positively. If you do this, you are doing world of good and pave way for somebody who can do in the middle where you failed many an occasion. Will you....

I think this one is squarely on Sharma's shoulder.  He batted at excruciatingly  slow pace on a placid pitch.  It reminded me of the Tendulkar's 100th ton at rate which did not leave enough overs and that eventually caused a humiliating defeat by Bangladesh. I guess even the great ones becomes selfish. Fact of the matter was the there was enough wicket and I would never understand why he continued dab and push! Less than eight overs were left when he finally fell. There too much pressure on batsmen who followed him to accelerate.  Nobody in the Indian team who scored more that 11 runs and had a strike rate over 100.  In my opinion, a bit of sanity in the top order after they reach 200 and so would have produced a defendable score even with the subpar bowling.

In Both games platform was set to 350 plus score, both time lack of big hitting curtailed the score to a non threatning one, on these wickets one can only get out if you play risky shots, wih 310 odd score the chasing team has to play 50 overs to win,  i would blame batting more than bowling.

I have predicted this yesterday(Pls read my comment before the game http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-india-2015-16/content/story/961913.html) 
</p>
<p>
1) One player is wasted. There is no need of a complete batsman(Pandey) to play after 45 overs.
2) There was no sixth bowling option for Dhoni like how Maxwell played for Aus.
3) With only part time bowlers(Jadeja), India can not defend any total.
4) Rishi Dhawan played equally gud as Sarn in warm up games but not given chance in another pace friendly pitch.
4) Experienced Bhuvneswar might hv made a difference in place of Sarn who conceded 13 runs in an over at criticle time.
5) Dhoni blamed the bowlers for the loss of India.
</p>

Teja Wu!!

Indians have to try chasing targets. Ashwin and jadeja have been nullified in these australian pitches. Australia lost only 3 wickets chasing a 300 plus target. Just three. Its an absolute waste of time to spend 8 hours to watch such games. I`ll get back to this series once the T20 internationals start. Dear Oneday cricket, rest in peace.

IND with a new team won ICC CT 2013 beating all the teams. Thereafter ODI rules were changed with use of 2 new balls &amp; 4 fielder restriction. These changes meant a big advantage for fast bowling oriented teams &amp; disadvantage for teams with strength in spin bowling &amp; reverse swing. With the fielder restriction 300 is not defendable score in batting friendly conditions. IND have played 16 matches(excluding UAE,IRE) from start of world cup &amp; have won 8. The batsman stats (Matches,30+, 50+ ,100+ scores are: Rohit 16, 7,6,4 ; Dhawan 16, 8,5,1; Kohli 16, 8. 5, 2; Rahane 14, 7, 5,0;  Dhoni 16, 8, 4,0.  The number of contributions in 8 wins( marked as *) batsman wise is : Rohit (*); Dhawan(***); Kohli(**); Rahane(**); Dhoni(****). IND batting despite good talent has not adapted well to rule changes and are not scoring adequately in first 40 overs/ leaving too much to do for last 10 overs with 5 fielder restriction. Therefore arguments against bowlers &amp; Captaincy have no legs to stand upon.

Blaming our bowling isn't correct! There were 2 dropped catches of Shaun Marsh and one easy run out chance missed...U just cannot commit these many errors in a single game, in addition to that we were clearly 20 runs short due to lack of ability of lower middle order (Dhoni, Pandey, Jadeja)...Please get rid of Dhawan and allow Rahane to open the innings, getting in Gurkeerat will give Dhoni another decent bowling option and giving overs to Rohit n Kohli can be avoided!

People keep blaming Rohit instead of getting down to the bottom of what the problem for India really is! The problem is their bowling is supremely mediocre! It has no teeth whatsoever. What was Rohit suppose to do? Get out at 99? He's doing what a batsman is suppose to do,make runs! Its the bowlers that are less than par,a problem India will always have until they don't stop worshiping batsmen. They only inspire batsmen,everyone in India wants to be a master batsman and not a bowler!

Scoring Tons in losses is a very hot debate now. I should say for  Tendulkar , YES his low scoring rate and some selfish nature of reaching personnel landmarks did cost india some cruicial runs to defend. Hence they always loose when Tendulkar Score tons. But Rohit's Scenario is very different. Even 350 would be easily chased by aussies. It is because of the bad bowling department not the fault of Rohit.  He scored Hundreds with a reasonable rate and did not cost soo many deliveries to reach the mark. Even he crossed 100 from 90 using 2 deliveries he could have added quick 20 . But even that 320 will be chased against this poor poor bowling unit. Only Sran the new comer seems to pose a threat from time to time. If that is the case for next 3 matches then india will face a threat of whitewash. If so Pls donot Burn Dhoni's Home he is a great captain. But instead you should try ashwin's home :v

@AL_BUNDY1: Don't want to start another Tendulkar debate. But looking at statistics, India won 33 times and lost 14 times when SRT scored an ODI century. so apparently, your statement doesn't fly

I dont think india is missing any players or they have wrong selections, all they need to do is arrange visas for Indian curators asap otherwise ashwin and jadeja will have six more bad days. Not good for world class.

BC you sound disappointed  that India lost rather than  give Australia
any credit for win as expected. This a brand new Aus sort of  bowling lineup, Rohit's innings was not chanceless getting life on out at 87 gloved behind on  not out no worries,No matter how to put it  This is s clinical displasy of superior cricket in all departments, so grapes are sour....anyone in this Aussie lineup can score when need requires......hic!!!

Old Dhoni made 230 competitive to the opposition and current Dhoni says and acts that even 330 is not enough. Old Dhoni selected horses for courses and current Dhoni is just stubborn with his combination. Old Dhoni made it tough for the opposition batters while fielding, current Dhoni just goes thru the motions. Old Dhoni was a terror to the bowlers(especially the ones bowling 40-50) and current Dhoni is finding it tough to connect the ball with his bat !!...Now who is out there who still thinks his time is not up !!

This loss is on Jadeja, Pandey, Dhoni and Rahane. They were so pathetic in the closing overs, it was not funny. They looked like amateurs. Jadeja was trying to place the ball instead of going for boundaries. India does not have finishers. Dhoni is a shadow of his prime and with all the IPL whoopla India can not come up with one hitter of "finisher" caliber. Or is it a selection bias?

Just shows how overrated the likes of Aswin, Jedeja are mate. Indian fans were calling them world class. yikes. Without those rag turners and dust bowls, they seem ordinary. No wonder Ashwin averages 50+ away from india.

The problem with India since the start of WC 2015 is the lack of power hitters down the order. This is especially obvious with the decline of MS Dhoni (I hope it is just loss of form-but don't think it is). The other problem is the rigid captaincy and selection of MS Dhoni who doesn't show the guts of backing youngsters (even if they are half cooked as per himself). If Shami hadn't injured himself, Bran wouldn't had a chance. One of the two spinners need to sit out (unless one of them is a reliable power hitter-none of them are). I would keep Ashwin and have Rishi or Gurkeerat in. The cautious approach by the top order is understandable since we don't show the confidence in our lower order. Nothing wrong in losing to the world champions in their own ground-but you need to show aggression and intention in your play and show a fighting spirit even with your so called limited resources.

Too much vitriol against India on these forums. It seems like we have been bundled out for 150 in both matches. Reality is that both matches have gone till the last over. India also has looked comfortable till the last 10 overs. Their newly minted weakness of inability to launch at the fab end and the old bad bowling habits are haunting them together. No shame in losing to a superior team but yes a different approach needs to be adopted. We have been blessed with Dhoni performing well over the years but guess it is time for another youngster to put his hand up and create a space for himself. Be patient guys. And to all India haters who spend their valuable energy here. My mom used to tell me that many people do not like you because secretly they want to be like you but cannot. Connect the dots.

Prblm with current Indian batting line up is they don't have a hitter who can score those quick runs.. The line up has so formal batsmen that's one reason why we can't post 320 - 340 totals..bring back Yuvraj or Yusuf Pathan. Bowlers needs to be given the confidence to bowl yokers and get the field set accordingly. Dhoni just can't blame the bowlers its a team game and should show more fight...

This is really beginning to confirm the depth of talent in Australia's ODI batting stocks, they are making these chases look easy and with Marsh, Khawaja, Burns, Lynn and Head in reserve they look like they'll remain formidable going into the next world cup.

I hope and pray for 0-5 loss , Indian cricket badly needs a change. In fact it needed this for past few years. A new captain, new thinking. Unless we infuse fresh thinking in Indian cricket and encourage new talent we will continue to stagnate. It not the loss, its the senseless of the loss.  Stronger Middle order, hitter at No 6, playing on one spinner abroad, nurturing a genuine all rounder these are a few of things which need to come out.

Now 5 Rohit tons in losing causes out of 10. Only 14 centuries out of 49 ODI centuries of Sachin comes in Losing cause which is only 28.57 Percent of his Long career.It shows not individual matters it is the team who wins or lose the battle. Now come to present Indian team at Abroad no matter India scores how many runs 400, 500 even 1000 Runs the end result is they will going to lose match and upcoming T20 World cup so no matter who X,Y,Z plays these matches.

Stop screaming guys. Why everyone has to blame dhoni, BCCI or others. You guys know it is expected. Be happy with our batting performance atleast.

"Australia is second to none in ODIs, there is a country mile difference between these two teams and India is still 2nd in the ODI rankings, pathetic. Don't remember when India beat Aus in an ODI last time" Exactly. Their ranking in ODI and Test is a joke. They got hammered in NZ and South-Africa as well. Pathetic

i dont agree that indian bowling is weak , if that is the case then aus bowling also concedes 300 runs , i think its all about strength of batting for both sides. dhawan should b dropped, pandey should open , yadav should b dropped rishi dhawan should b there and gurkeerat should b included in the middle order in place of pandey

Sachin made 49 centuries in odi and in 32 centuries India won the game so donot compare Rohit with Sachin. Plz do not get frustrated on Rohit. he is selfish and played for himself. He played well in both matches and scored centuries if ur bowlers could not defend this what can he do. He is making runs consistantly still people have lot of problem this guy. After his runout India lost 4 wickets more no one scored to get 330 runs. It is not fault of Rohit. Australians played more better. ur fielders were pathetic dropped lollypops then how we can win matches.

I can't understand why people ate always this Australian team 3 Rd string 4thbstring etc everybody in this team is very much part of their main team and only starc and Cummins are missing and even they will be belted in this super flat roads and also people are blaming this Indian bowling unit for their inability to defend the 300totals but they fail to understand that 300 is a sub lar total in this tracks .it is the inability of the Indian batting lineup to post required total to be blamed.they seriously lacks a lower order hitter to score quick runs and also Indian batsman's are scoring too slow at times in the middle overseas to make things worse for themselves at the death.also Australian Boers too were not great they are also not doing any fantastic thing it us just their batting is superior and has some big hitters

Liked what i saw with him.  Boland still some distance to go - bowls a lot of full-tosses
- would cost a lot if we were to bowl second.

It at least proves that Rohit is a flat track bully without boundaries. It also proves that indian battling lineup worth 310 max whether they lose 2 wickets or 8 wickets and offcourse Rohit's centuries are not enough to win a game for india on flat track. His celebration also showed how much he relished his innings jumping so high that it took a while for him to come back to the ground like aliens.

It was a disappointing finish for India, and the last ten overs had brought just 75 runs for the loss of six wickets. It was a period that arguably lost India the match after their strong start. &lt;---- sorry but 300 + is a great score on any ground against any team,we cant expect all the batsman to play with the same flair as the most inform batsman in the side. 
The issue is with India's bowling, fast bowling (I dont even know where to begin) while quicker compared to the past decade it is in truth toothless, they dont swing, they dont seam. Does anyone really think now after decades of training and millions spent into their Pace academy a couple of bowlers in early 140 will trouble the Aussies, who have had the fastest bowlers in the world! Ashwin and Jadeja are ineffective outside India and this is now a fact. 
Finally in their obsession with pace India have also ruined Kumar who was a terrific swing bowler at 125 clicks but now bowls 135 clicks and gets hammered.

What happened to Ashwin? Suddenly he has become some very ordinary bowler. Why are people blaming dhoni? i didnt watch the game but the scorecard is screaming loud and clear that this indian bowling line up is pathetic. India i think is the team who has lost most number of matches after scoring over 300 runs. Unless dhoni has made some massive captaincy blunders, he cant be blamed for this pathetic performance of bowlers

We need to give Kedar Jadhav a few more chances. He has done phenomenally well in domestic cricket and has been decent in the internationals that he played in. So in all fairness, he needs to be given more chances. He is definitely capable of hitting bog shots lower down the order.

Well played again Rohit Sharma!  He is in tremendous form.  Again Ashwin and Jadeja are only effective when the conditions suit them, other than that they look very ordinary.  What more can be said about Ishant Sharma?  Dhoni's defensive approach demonstrates that he lacks confidence in his bowling attack.

Yep when they get all their quicks back on deck firing they will be a formidable team even in overseas conditions, probably just need one more world class batsman and they will dominate for 6 or 7 years in tests and one day.

Is this really a surprise? This Indian team really is a disaster waiting to happen, if it hasn't happened already! Only Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli (and to a certain extent, Ajinkya Rahane) are worth their salt in this current ODI setup. Shikhar Dhawan is too inconsistent and the less said about the middle order the better. 
</p>
<p>
We desperately need a hitter and unfortunately, there is noone we can pick who could bat like Maxwell or Faulkner does for Australia. In fact, there is hardly anyone you would classify "explosive" in the true sense of the term in world cricket today. Rohit Sharma waits till its too late to start hitting(an Australian opener with over a 100 would have turned on the afterburners straight away), Rahane can't clear big boundaries, Dhoni has lost the ability to go big and Jadeja is a hitter in name only.
</p>
<p>
High time we gave someone such as Hardik Pandya a chance- I am not saying he is going to be the savior but he seems the be the best option in the domestic circuit.

Do not expect too much from this team.How dhawan get this much opportunity??Too Sad.Rohit and Kohli under extreme pressure.If they get out cheaply this team cannot even score 230 runs.India have such a worse lower middle order players who cannot even hit a four when required. we are badly missing  some hard hitters at the death.We need to drop under performing players and nurture talent youngsters for next world cup.What Dhoni is doing as a player and captain???sent back dhawan to india.Bring Hardic pandya as a hitter.give chance to gurkeerat and rishi dhawan.open with rahane.do some experiments.Rohit and kohli cannot score runs always.Ask indian bowlers to use a bit of their brain while bowling rather than bowling like a machine.

Glaring selection issues -- Gurkeerat not selected although he is a Power hitter, he can bowl off spin too ( one a match for India A vs Austalia A -- through bowling). He could have played instead of Pandey.

2 spinners played,  Jadeja got a wicket but Rishi Dhawan should have been played, instead of him. Dhoni is obstinate.

Same old team combination , you cannot expect different results with the same method. Sick and tired of Dhoni's  stubbornness.

I think India people should stop blaming Dhoni. India Always looses outside the subcontinent. Its not the captain's fault but its the inability of whole indian team over the years. India need 'poor rated' pitches'  to spin the non-spin deliveries. When there are no such pitches they simply fall behind. 
</p>
<p>
Well Played Australia with a 4th String Bowling Attack. Its way better than International Indian Bowling attack.  Again Ashwin proved a nothing bowler outside the sub continent.

Rohit Sharma is another Tendulkar - Every time he scores a century, his team loses! We need team players, not selfish players. He should have accelerated after scoring a fifty. Dhoni should open with Rahane, and play Rishi Dhawan instead of Ashwin or Jadeja, Why is he playing 2 spinners in Australia? Everybody knows that our spinners are useless outside India. But, our stubborn as a mule Captain will keep playing them simply because he likes them, and doesn't want to try a rookie. Maybe it's time to get rid of Dhoni!

2 matches 300 plus scores could not be defended, this means seriously toothless bowling. Someone should strike isn't it in an international match. With this kind of bowling india can't win match not only against Australia but any good team

Very predictable story, the problem with Indian bowling line up, especially with spinners that they been living in a bubble by performing on rag-turning Indian wickets where even part-time spinners are hard to play but when they go out and play on true wickets, they get exposed, world-class spinners suppose to be good everywhere, I think India needs to think about playing leg-spinners and proper left-arm bowler on these pitches, offer-spinners and dart bowlers like Jedeja is not going to give control and take wickets in middle over.

Where are true Australian pitches? since when did they start making roads? AU cricket thrives on both bat and ball. Why do you give batsman such a favor in preparing pitches? same thing happened in previous series.

The crucial moment of the match I thought Rohit's run out. May be India could have achieved  another 30 runs more if he had stayed till the end. Even that was enough we don't know. The way Indian's are bowling I don't think even 400 is enough. Dependency on Aswin/Jadeja is too much and they really don't look like good bowlers in Australian land.  But, Dhoni can not think of a team without Ashwin &amp; Jadeja.

Really hurting a lot to see India Losing after putting up good batting performance... Whom to be blamed?
None other than Dhoni and Selectors. Dhoni don't want to drop Jadeja, Dhawan, Ashwin. On what basis selectors (former players) selected Jadeja as a ALLROUNDER? First of all what is the meaning of ALLROUNDER? One who contributes with the bat or Ball or occasionaly BOTH? in 150 Odd ODIs how many times Jadeja contributed with the bat or ball or with Both.... He scored few 50s, how they were scored, after having India losing few quick wickets at the top and coming playing a blocking game at the strike of 60% is not the allround performance (infact India never won those matches). He NEVER contributed for India's win. ALLROUNDER is the one who saves his side from defeat either with the bat/ball or both.... Jadeja can play Test as BOWLER, again not as an ALLROUNDER... Kallis, Kapil, Afridi, James Faulkner, Flintoff - They are the ALLROUNDERs...but NOT defeintely Jadeja.... He is half bowle

We can now excuse SL for what happened in NZ with a fledgling team whereas with a full strength team India has no killer instinct to win matches in Australia. How many repeated chances have they had recently in Australia in ODIS alone against them, it is unfair by other teams. Aussies have been extraordinarily been kind to them providing flat pitches &amp; a second or third string attack.

@JOSE...P:  I think he tried his flight and dip in his first spell in  WACA only to be tonked for sixes and hence is bowling flat with marginal turn. Clearly tells me that the Aussies have the upper hand of him, he is simply afraid to toss the ball up!.  let's see how he goes about this now, mind you Lyon or Swann would struggle in these conditions as well, maybe a good time for Ashwin to give a call to  Kumble or Bedi!. For the next game though, i would consider replacing Jadeja with Guru, better bat and more or less the same or better bowl .

Kohli and Sharma's slow rate of around 90.00 lost the game for the Indians.
When playing the Aussies 300 is not enough. India should bat 2nd whenever they can or score around 340 if they are batting first.

Rohit has done his job great. As an opener his role is to attack the new ball whilst keeping middle order safe, which he did. He scored hundreds, set the platform only for the hitters to fail. I am jealous of Australia because even their weak bowlers are better than India's main bowlers.

I'm interested, what would be Australia's first choice ODI bowling lineup if everyone was fit and healthy, not being rested, etc. I would say Starc, Hazlewood and Patinson. Pat Cummins of course. Coulter-Nile might be next in line after that I guess. This lot have done pretty exceptionally given their far from the first picks. A bunch of other kids doing well in the BBL as well. I would have Behrendorff in there ahead of all three of Paris, Boland and Richardson. When you add the allrounders in there - Faulkner, Maxwell and M.Marsh currently, but agian there are at least a couple of others - it becomes a pretty formidable stable. And now, dare I say it, the batting seems to be developing some depth as well. Can you imagine Usman Khawaja being left out of any other ODI side in the world right now given his form?! Let alone being left out even when the side has two of the top six (Warner and M.Marsh) being rested. If it is DEPTH that wins you matches then Australia have it in spades.

The fact India did not score 10 runs an over in last 10 was because Rohit got out in very unfortunate way. It's a problem that India doesn't have good hitters looks like at this point who can hit big besides him or prabably Kohli. Kohli is barely lasting these days till 40th over so someone down in the order needs to play that 15 ball 30-40 runs game (missing Raina yet...the value he brought to the team). 
It would be very harsh to criticize Dhoni (wonderful player) but certainly that's one zing we are missing right now as clearly he is struggling to come back in form.

Sadly Dhoni keeps repeating the same mistakes! Why does India need 2 spinners on a pace bowler's pitch? India lost narrowly in ODI#1 with 4 balls to spare due to 2 spinners  instead of 4 pace bowlers +1 spinner+ captaincy bloopers!. I had mentioned in my comments after )DI #1 that Pandya should also have been in ODI squad, as he is a medium pacer with hitting power + Dhawan being useless at the top. Both Chand &amp; Pandya are burning the leather with their heroics. Send Axar &amp; Dhawan back to India &amp; replace them with Pandya &amp; Chand for ODI #3. Also Dhoni no longer deserves his place either as a Captain or WK. I agree with Sir_Ivor on this issue. Rohit will make a far better ODI captain. Losing after scoring 308 twice confirms a poor bowling side with equally inept captaincy. Great knocks by Rohit, Rahane &amp; Kohli went in vain again.

@AFanOfGoodCricket -agree with u. Before entirely blaming the bowling, we should analyse our batting deeply. though we scored 309 inboth matches, we should have been anything between 330-340 in both. More so the position we were in and considering aussie bowlers were inexperienced. cudnot accelerate in both matches. Same had happened against RSA in those lost chases. Dhoni saying that had we accelerated, early we may have lost wkts and wudnot have reachd 300 even - thatz ridiculous. That shows the lack of belief in lower order which includes him. Ashwin &amp; Jadeja exposed badly. todays match we were nearly 5.80/ovr at the end of 23rd and then finished only just over 6/ovr. this is turning out a boring series where there is no fight given to opposition. As much as u praise rohit or kohli, their failure to explode or target some bowlers resulted in total being much below par.

Drop Shikkar, open with Rahene. Give chance to Rishi, play with one spinner. Australian pitches are hard. Wrist spinners are effective than finger spinners. Dhoni has to rework on his strategy.

Lots of common remarks in this forum:
1. Second string australian side- It's the bowling only.Aussie batting is full strength.Big hitters abound.And they are chasing, business end.Oh, India lack Shami, Praveen, Mohit.
2. Indians fail to restrict 300- Well, last time, Australians failed to defend 350 in India, remember?
3. Drop spinners, bring in pace, Aussie pitches-It still has some validity, but who do you bring in?What guarantee is there that it'll work?Can't the spinners bowl differently(i.e. more spin &amp; flight, off stick line, good field, Aussie weakness)?But Mishra could've been tried, I think.
4. Score 350- If 310 doesn't work with a bowling attack, why should 350?If there is a leak in the bucket, do you just pour more into it?
Overall, I felt the lineup for 2nd ODI was OK.India's problem lies in software, not hardware.Pacers(Yadav the most) need discipline, the spinners some spin and flight.I still think India can come back, even win the series.

I have seen majority of my fellow indian fans saying indian batting is fine but if you look deep both scores of 300 plus major contributions came from rohit virat and when they fell rest hardly contributed if rohit virat fail together or individually does indian middle order have it in them  to score big runs only forthcoming matches can say given the middle order performance in first two odi i have my doubts

Dhoni's loss form , his lacklustre captaincy and the absence of Raina and Yuvaraj have adversely affected India's performance in the last 10 overs of ODIs . India was never strong in bowling . Let Dhoni not attribute all India's to the bowlers . Why is Dhoni still clinging on to the game of cricket . The upcoming IPL will prove that he is neither the feared batsman or the shrewd captain that he once  was .

what india is missing is Raina/Yuvi/Old Dhoni like 18 ball 38 runs in between. Not saying pick Raina/Yuvi, but somebody has to do that job. and leave Rohit alone. other batsmen has to play own game and not second role to Rohit.

in overseas condition, India has no good fast attack. The fastest and our best bowler is going at over 7 an over, no point playing additional fast bowlers..if batting first, india should keep 350 as target, let ashwin open, drop dhawan and play gurkeerath..

If I am correct,Today ashwin bowled orthodox attacking off spin and that too he bowled over the wicket and he could have got 2 wickets viz shaun marsh and George bailey if catches weren't missed.If anybody have watched the match with proper cricket knowledge,no one would have criticized his bowling.If ashwin had bowled round the wicket,he would have bowled an economic spell but wouldn't have bowled wicket taking deliveries.Today India were short of 30 to 40 runs as the pitch has nothing to assist the bowlers.While umesh yadav &amp; ishant sharma bowled erratic deliveries straying the ball without any consistency.While Brainder sran bowled brilliantly at the end and  the start.From next odi Brainder sran needs to bowl over the wicket which looks really brilliant.I am awaiting for rishi dhawan to make his debut in place of umesh yadav while bhuvaneshwar kumar can play in place of ishant sharma.India is in dire need of pinch hitter at number 5.While I expect dhoni to do attacking captaincy.

It is sad that India plays with 10 players with Shikhar as the walking passenger!!!  He fails continuously and yet he opens the batting.  Secondly, besides Rohit and Kohli, India lacks genuine players who can hithitters like Warner, Finch, Smith, Faulkner.  Rohit and Kohli is in danger if they launch out early because next batsmen are not dependable.  How many match-winning innings did Jadeja play in his career?  Ashwin is predictable as he sees the same shot and perishes the same. Even if India was able to score another 20 runs, Australia has the power-hitters to still achieve

I hate to see comments against Rohit Sharma. Some say he is too slow. But the fact that he hit the most sixes in the last two games and outscored the rest of the team,
proves otherwise. He has done his fair share. Its the bowlers who are not tight enough.

Well played Rohit great knock.dhoni should drop dhawan and ask pandey or rahane to open .selectors should add pandya for last two odis as he is in terrific form and can play the role of finisher that we lacking in slog overs.India should try and chase targets as we  have chasing king kohli and lacking of gud bowlers so the soln is chasing targets rather than defending.

Been an ardent Dhoni and India supporter but have to say am bored of this team and supporting this team. The same old spinners, the same old failure to pick wickets. The same team setup, the same faces. Same old Ravindra Jadeja. Same old no allrounders instead pick an extra batsman. Same old no pinch hitter. Same old unwillingness to experiment. Same old excuses. The same old selectors picking the same old team. I can go on and on.  I say its time to move on from supporting this team.

I think we are being too hard on Ashwin. Unlike at Perth he was much better today and there were quite a few edges and very close opportunities not to mention the tough chance put down by rahane in slips. India in hindsight should not have played 2 spinners on these wickets. Austalia have hardly bowled spin in these 2 matches and that is because they know they have nothing on offer here. It is crazy to bowl these 2 at Perth and Brisbane where traditionally Australia have gone in with 4 quicks. If they are dropped in Melbourne and Sidney it will be funny as those 2 are the grounds known to assist spin.

They're called "runs" for a reason. The Indian batsmen walked, shuffled and jogged their "runs", often turning twos into ones and threes into twos. Running hard creates pressure and forces mistakes. Jogging or walking makes life easy.

@Damien,  can't expect the batting to fire every-time.  The bowling must be good enough.  I know we are putting the new-comers on trial and that they are new to the job but also hope that they learn the tricks soon.  Good for them and for the team as well !! Hope Josh plays at the 'G in place of Boland, doubt that though !!

for india, this series will be learning curve for youngsters...that is the only purpose of this series..if we are of opinion that 350 was possible, its not easy for batsmen to play big shots from ball one...and with field restrictions in last it becomes difficult to accelerate...the last 5-6 overs india fall away as there no big power hitter down the order..or infact after no.3...so with these flat pitches...india would not be able to win...MSD would  do well to give chance to youngsters...yadav for  rishi and axar for jadeja  would be  worth the try...also gurkeerate can be given a game....i hope they get a chance in a series in which india is going to lose anyway..

Contrary to most posts here, this wasn't as flat a surface as the AUS &amp; Ind bowlers made it out to be. It was definitely much better than Perth. AUS were rubbish with the ball in the first 20 overs &amp; fed balls to Kohli's pads. Kohli hasn't looked at ease in any format since his weakness has been exposed. AUS looks d only team who doesn't keep attacking him in his dreary zone. Luckily, they got him &amp; Rohit run-out. India bowled much better but fielded pathetically. A dolly drop by Ishant, a difficult but catchable chance in slips, a missed run-out &amp; Sran almost pulled off a screamer. India's slog over batting cost them. Dont think MSD could have anything different as a batsman or captain. Dropping Raina was a big mistake

This is turning out to be very similar to India -Australia series in 2013. 300+ runs chased down very easily, only this time the scores are lower and takes almost 50 overs to chase down. I think the reason why the scores have not been 350+ so far is because of the bigger boundaries. Many fours hit in these two matches which landed some distance before the boundary could well be six in India. That is not happening here.
It will be very interesting to see what runs they score at Manuka oval which I believe has the biggest boundaries in Australia. I would also like to see Chris Lynn play last two ODIs.

@Vvv24, spot on mate!!! You've got to give credit to Maxi - he's better than that Ashwin. Lyon would do about as well as any acclimatizing spinner would in such conditions ie no dust or turn and only a fool would be prepared to write him off before it really matters!!! Lyon the best spinner unlike this bloke.

India has failed to produce world class bowlers who can win them a game after the likes of Kapil Dev, Manoj Prabhakar, Anil Kumble and Zaheer Khan. Pace with good line and length can win u a game. Aaron and Yadav are fast but their line and length is ordinary. India should take help from Pakistan or Australia when it comes to Pace Bowling..

Sran's effort was commendable. The IPL has destroyed Indian cricket. Shami when fit is good, but otherwise all the others have to go and that Dhoni needs to be sacked. Do BCCI realise how we India fans get mocked by other supporters? Even Bangladesh has better bowling attack than us. This is humiliating and the only way things will change is if we as fans stop watching the matches and stop going to the stadium. Losing is part of sport, but it's the manner in which you lose and I'm absolutely fed up. I urge fans to hurt BCCI where it is painful by not watching the matches on TV and not going to the stadiums. Revenues will take massive hits that way.

It was during an Australian test series last year Dhoni decided to retire...Is there any hope like that for him to do it during this series....
Reasons:
1)He is no longer a batsman to suit middle order.His form is no where near Kohli or Rahane to bat ahead of them in batting order
2)His captaincy is no longer operated by his brain..But by the pride  :I AM ALWAYS RIGHT....While the host country didn't take any specialist spinner,he took two and lost twice.Due to pressure,even if hechange his tactics next match,he will surely try his best to prove he is right(Eg:Gurkeerath in South African ODI series)
3)All great Indian skippers had the same fate..Creep in the team for years out of form..(Eg : Ganguly,Azhar,Kapil)
After all,I was a great fan of Dhoni.Even started supporting CSK only due to him.....Selectors,please open your eyes..Get him out of the team..So as Shikar Dhawan..Promote Rahane to open..Get big hitters like Surya Kumar Yadhav,Hardik Pandey etc in team..

Will not rate the Indian bowlers bad. In the next 2 matches I would love to see India chase the total and if they succeed you need to rate the Aussies bowling as bad also. So let us wait till the end of the series and then judge. Coming to bad comments on Ashwin I expected this and all of us should remember that Aussie pitches are flat and the white ball barely helps bowlers and especially spinners with 2 new balls. Look at Anderson he is worst in SA but king in England. Same happens to every bowler. I will not judge Ashwin on this ODI tour.

It was always spinners Ashwin and Jadeja who did well for India. Indian quicks were clueless many times (post ZAK time - till WC'15), it was Ashwin who bowled at different phases( poweplays, death overs). I guess people here do not know the fact that Ashwin never bowled his full quota in 11-40 overs till UAE match in WC'15. he may not be the wicket taker but was the strike bowler, had given breaks and controlled things. I believe outside subcontinent quick bowler should bowl better and spinners for supporting role but that was not the case with India as there were no genuine quick/swing bowler after Zaheer

India's bowling has always been their weak link. Dhoni at his best always found a way to win even with a mediocre bowling line up, perhaps he's lost that midas touch for now but they really need to find a couple of decent bowlers who don't go for over 5.5 for their 10 overs and give them a wicket or two.

Dhoni at his best always found a way to win even with a mediocre bowling line up, perhaps he's lost that midas touch for now but they really need to find a couple of decent bowlers who don't go for over 5.5 for their 10 overs and give them a wicket or two.

<p>
Dhoni  is clueless as  a captain and also an excess baggage in the squad. Selectors should take Dhawan out and should ask Rahane to open so that India can accommodate another pace bowler. As long as Dhoni is in the squad, India can't able to think of playing quarter finals in T20 world cup. He has no vision.

I wonder how this indian team is coping up with this embarassing defeat. dhoni should stop captaining the team otherwise his captaincy is going to get tarnished and shred to bits by this super smith team

Ashwin is doing the same mistake, which Bhajji started doing towards the fag end of his career (ignoring the temporary resurrection now).

<p>
Increasing the pace. Ignoring the flight, and consequently losing the dip.

I am talking only about the two ODIs against Oz.

Even if India get whitewashed, nothing is going to change. Indian cricket has a massive, malignant tumour and changing the captain is not the ultimate solution. If India had lost knowing the bowlers had played to their best, I would have not been upset.

With Ashwin and Jadeja taken out of the bowling equation, Ind is unlikely to defend even a 350+ score. Their medium pacers are more like net bowlers for Aussie batsmen.  Ind was at least another 30-40 runs short just like in the 1st ODI. Rohit Sharma slowed down considerably approaching his 100 which stopped the momentum they were building after a good partnership with Kohli. With 100 for the asking, Rahane tried to up the ante and lost his wkt in a selfless manner. It is clear Dhoni lost his ability for big hits. In a similar situation, he would have scored a rapid fire 35-40 few years earlier. Now, he can barely manage 1s and 2s.  I think the Kohli era in all formats (similar to what Dhoni had himself) is coming after World T20 tournament.

Dhoni got the reason to lose the match wrong once again. He should have heard what Smith told in the post-match presentation. India were looking good to score 340-350; but their middle order IPL heros failed to capitalize on Rohit-Kohli-Rahane's excellent effort. India's Bowlers did better than the Australians in most part of the innings. Still Dhoni targeted the Bowlers to blame and demoralize them. When you score only 75 runs in the last overs with 8 wickets at Hand on a very high scoring ODI, for God's sake, do not blame your Bowlers.

Here is wat Dhoni needs to DO ASAP- drop Shikhar, Move Rahane to open, come in at 4, Pandey &amp; Gurkeerat @ 5,6. Ashwin Bhuvi IShant * Sran. Axar or Jaddu can replace Gurkeerat if pitch needs another spinner.and most importantly set right fileds for bowlers

This is unbelievable! These first two matches were too similar in terms of how they were played and their outcome. India needs to do some things differently. They should drop Shikar Dhawan. They should also reorganize the batting order to take advantage of the last ten overs. Australia are very strong at home. Their bowling is inexperienced and weakish, but their batting is strong and freakish. I hope India would change their team composition and approach to the game.

Why isn't anyone complaining of flat pitches now? The piches in India atleast aided the spinners but this is insult to the game we play... Nothing for the bowlers and team batting second lost with the exact target to shoot for... How does this make for a fair contest between bat and the bowl... the common ruse used by anyone losing in the subcontinent...

Ashwin asusual useless outside asia, even we have seen him in last SA tour before WC. He was lucky becoz some of his overs played by marsh &amp; finch, otherwise his 10 overs figures will be 85 or more. He talk too much before this tour,  told that he dont need pitch assistance ,what he did in 2 odis ? Jadeja looks better than him also he can bat. Ashwin needs pitches like last series agst SA, dust pitches anyone can bowl there, jadeja also took 23 wkts there. Many ppl call him best bowler that was joke of the century. Bhajji better than him in his peak time, we all know he bowled agst one of the best batsman also in 2008 series agst aus bowled superbly. Very below avg from him today also.  Aus have to prepare dust in the pitch in next rest of series then only this ordinary bowler will bowl better, I will not suprise if dhoni drops him one or two odis. Too much talk and overconfident after bowled in bowling assistance tracks in srilanka &amp; home,now he cant speak a word?

@Ashikjc man! you are really a genius. do you watch cricket really? who is India's strike bowler in last 3 ICC outings. did you forget about last Aus tour, world cup, t20 wc 14 and champions trophy. we don't have many quick bowlers who can fit into final XI, India couldn't go with more than 3 seamers. by ur logic, had India played 1 or 2 quicks instead of spinners, India could have won??

Australia had a good plan, even though playing with inexperienced bowlers like Kane, Borland, Paris, Hastings, Faulkner they all stick to their basics and not allow easy runs to India. Good death bowling by Boland, Hastings and Faulkner. India lacks good death bowlers, comparing indian bowling and Aus bowling is not apples to apples comparison. Playing with 2 spinners on a fast, pacy, little bouncy pitches is a big blunder. Not sure why they picked Rishi Dhawan, if Dhoni does not have confidence in Rishi. Absolute mayhem in team selection. We are touring Aus from last 20 years, why didn't we get it that spinners don't work in Aus. Pace bowling all rounders, good death bowlers will work. As far as batting goes I don't see any indian batsman who can accelerate the run rate both in first &amp; last 15 overs, Sehwag, Yuvraj, like attacking batsmen in the team. Sad state of affairs of team selection - missing Wkt taking &amp;death bowlers, attacking batsmen,all rounders, good captaincy and planning

.Not only India All teams are struggled to Play James Faulkner,James Hopes and Ian Harvey,This is Because Variation.
India Have to find At least one Bowler of such a kind of Bowling.
If we think smartly it is easy to play James Faulkner,following are the some of the tips to play Faulkner Bowling:
</p>
<p>
    Do not play straight bat for his bowling
    Play lots of sweep and slog sweep as far as possible.
    i understood it is difficult to play sweep shot for faster bowler,but also remember that he is not a fast bowler.he bowled 4 slow balls out of 6 balls.
    to cross the off stump when running affect bowling rhythm.if you cross the stump definitely he will not bowl slow ball.
    last but not least to move,jump,cross,down the track for each delivery affect bowling rhythm for Faulkner.

Following are the some of the strategy for winning next three match
1.Omit Shikher Dhawan from the team,Promote Ajankay Rahane to the opening position along with Rohit Sharma,Dhoni Strictly ask Ishant Sharma to field better.
All the Bowlers bowling Fuller Deliveries rather than short and length Balls.As far As I Concerned only difference between both the team is the only Bowler that is James Faulknar.In both matches he reduced 30 run shortage of India total.Not only India All teams are struggled to Play James Faulkner,James Hopes and Ian Harvey,This is Because Variation.India Have to find At least one Bowler of such a kind of Bowling.

Dhoni's stupid captaincy again proved. I am not Dhoni's hater but somehow he lost his innovativeness over a period of time and thinking too much into the game and making himself complex in understanding the game. This is just the way Ashwin did few months back trying out more variations and lost control of his bowling. Similar way Dhoni also lost control of his Captaincy and thus we need new thinking in the team. Kohli/Rahane should come as Captain. It is simple. sometimes those who are not deeply involved does think better than those deeply involved. These are fast bowling pitches and flat batting tracks. So, Jadeja should have been replaced with Rishi Dhawan who can also hit big shots in the end as proved in his batting against South africa A. Sikhar Dhawan as opener should be replaced with Gurukeerat and slight change in batting order will do good. 
My order: Rohit, M.Pandey, Dhoni, Kohli, Rahane, Gurukeerat, R.Dhawan,Ashwin, Ishant, Umesh,Sran...

Australia are either treating this series as a joke or looking further down the track by selecting these no name bowlers and resting everyone else.
Probably already looking at building a large potential squad for the next World Cup. Only three years away.

India lacked the 6th bowling option in this game. India should bring in Gurkeerat in place of Shikar Dhawan. Atleast in upcoming games, spinners have to pick more wickets as these matches would be played on slower tracks. Playing 11 for Melbourne - Rohit, Pandey, Kohli, Rahane, Gurkeerat, Dhoni, Jadeja, Ashwin, Ishant, Umesh, Sran.

Another chance given to jadeja, and dhawan another defeat. India will face defeat if dhawan, jadeja and ashwin plays in the eleven . how the selectors keep on  picking dhawan for  continuously,  he is a limited player with limited shots, he is also in weak zone of short pitch stuff. The result shows that the inability of selectors not players.

Credit goes to Smith&amp; co. for putting pressure on Indian team.

<p>
(Contd.)
My verdict-It's much better to win with a good batting performance(300-310) and a decent bowling performance(280-290) than with an extreme batting performance(330) and ineffective bowling performance(315-320)
Why-more people(11) delivering an acceptable performance in the first case rather than less people(6) delivering an extreme performance in the second(Sorry,  Dhoni).Estimate the odds in each case.
India didn't win WC 2011 on batting alone.Yuvraj the bowler and Zac were critical and indispensable.
India didn't win T20 WC 2007 on batting alone.Pathan, Bhajji,RP, Sreesanth were there.
India didn't win Champions Trophy 2013 on batting alone.Ashwin &amp; Jadeja were there.

I find it odd that the test captain isnt the odi captain. It shows where the bcci priorities are imo, and that is in the shorter formats of the game and they dont do them particularly well these days.

I don't understand what is the purpose of this series. Exact replica again and again. Don't Australia have some thing better to do? At this rate , it will take India a 100 years to win one match.

I wonder what Ms. Dhoni's excuse is tonight? Blaming the umpires twice in a row is too boring. Maybe the pitch? Crowd behaviour? Ah it's probably time to bring the racism or sledging cards out again 
One thing is for certain, India are a far superior team and would certainly have won if not for &lt;insert pathetic excuse here&gt;

the difference was  just 76 odd runs in last 10 overs.u need to have players like yuvraj raina to score 10an over in last ten. I m afraid to say selectors got it wrong.still there is time send yuvi raina back flying to aus

Starc , Patterson , Cummings, Sittle ect can have a nice rest knowing they won't be required for this series. 
Two nill up and the Australia can have the series wrapped up on Sunday. I didn't think it was going to be so easy with a second or third string bowling attack.

I feel for the Indian team here .. they have played well over the past 2 ODI's however have no results to show for. Scoring 300 runs consecutively in Australia against an Australian attack (not matter how weak) is no mean feat. I dont think teams have done this too often before. Our bowling attack could do with some discipline, far too many boundary balls today although the spinners showed marked improvement. We need a 1-40 in 10 type fast bowler desperately !

Why don't we play a better bowling line-up at the 'G ?  Boland just doesn't belong
there and Kane is not ready yet.  I wouldn't bet my money on this bowling line-up
to defend totals.  What if we bat first in the next game ?

For gods sake pls hand over the captaincy to Kohli. Dhoni is such a pathetic captain, when you know that batting is your strength why he chose to bat first. How many more chances to Shikhar Dhawan. Just when Jaddu &amp; Ash were building pressure he took off Jaddu &amp; brought Umesh to release the pressure.Not allowing Rishi Dhawan to play. Also Rohit should be warned he was playing for personal milestone after umpire saved him . He crawled from 89 to 100 . Sorry to say this Rahane should either open the innings or should not play , he consumed a lot of deliveries early on and made up for it later bur by that time we had lost momentum. We need some wicket taking bowlers who can take wickets on these Australian highways. Please reduce the no of foreign players in ipl from 4 to 2. IPL is only harnessing Outside instead of ours

one thing which is quite obvious, the Aussie batsmen seem to be at home when playing Ashwin, they have worked him out in the limited overs . we have seen Ashwin bowl in the world cup , bowled beautifully with dip and flight and henxe dismissing him as a dust bowl bowler is nonsense. I guess this is a real test for Ashwin , quite curious to see what changes in the next game.

Another easy victory for the Aussies and congrats to them for this performance without their key bowlers like Stark , Cummins , Pattinson and Hazelwood. One more miserable performance from the Indian bowlers,  especially the much vaunted spinners Ashwin and Jadeja ,  who are totally toothless if the pitch is tailor-made for them. Indian selectors should seriously think about not sending spinners like them to Australia or NZ or South Africa . Well done Rohit! It is sad that his efforts are wasted by his bowlers.

Unless dhoni gets out of team and with jadeja and ashwin india will losing matches.there is no point in watching matched with ms dhoni in the team with his favourite members.Domestic performers will not get a chance unless MSD retires. Its High time for MS dhoni to retire or atleast handover the captaincy so that new faces in bowling section can able to see.Playing 2 spinners in australian pitches is biggest blunder. Aswhin is in effective in these pitches and is suitable only in sub continent wickets. indian team selection Management should use their brain while selecting team other than sub continent matches.its very painful to watch matches with this type of bowlers getting selected where many guys are knocking the inidan team door. its high time to wake up for selection comitte to not listen to MS where he always wants his favourite cricketers to be in playing eleven.request MS to step down from captaincy.please

At this point of time a whitewash by Aussies will do a lot of good for this Indian side as it will open the eyes of selectors and specially BCCI.. Where are they spending big bucks ?? There has to be talented bowlers in India I guess. What is NCA MRF pace academy doing ?? I have never played cricket and don't know the technical aspect but you don't need to be a player to observe the deteriorating quality of players representing India these days. I am commenting this after observing our performance over the years which has been really shamefull.  No offence but its really hurting fans like me who neither claims Indian team to be BEST  when they win at home nor bash them unnecessarily for few losses. But things are getting pretty shameful as results are not changing a bit. BCCI needs to think about it as they may loose many fans/followers if such performance donot improve.

It is about time for Dhoni to step down as ODI player. He does not play the accelerator role at the end, his captaincy does not have new wrinkles (the Aussies know him too well), and it is better he focus on the T20 cricket.

I thought Aussies were short of experienced fast bowlers. Most names were unheard and relatively new. But used home conditions well to defeat the Indians. Rohit Sharma has been an aggressive one day player at home or away. Virat Kohli has been batting well in Australia now &amp; in the past. If the series is to liven up, Indian's have to show their fighting quality and ability.
On the other side, Pakistanis have brought a spectacular win over the Kiwis.
In South Africa, Test match is balanced evenly. Let us what next three days will produce to win the test match?

My synopsis-1.Yadav- lack of enough discipline, +10-12 runs at least 2. Ishant-extras, wides, +10 runs 3.Jadeja-not too bad, still flat on occasions, 1 or 2 short balls, occasional leg side ball, maybe+5-6 runs 4. Ashwin-much better than 1st game, but too many leg side balls, a little unfortunate at times 5.Sran-Discipline initially and inexperience under pressure shown, unnecessary slower balls at times, +6-7 runs. 6.Fielding- dropped catches were costly but overall quite good, some 2 s could have been stopped.
My recommendation- 1. maintain the resolve under pressure.Ind won't win an easy game in the next 3, visualise opposition counter attacks and prepare a ready strategy collectively to be used under pressure.
  2.If no Mishra, then A&amp;J should continue flighting and tweaking but on off stump line with supporting field. 
3.Pacers should focus on discipline, keep 2 slips if possible. 
4.Batting is fine, just last 6-7 overs need to be slightly more proactive if batting 1st(contd.)

Let us wait and watch if we lose 5-0,then may be our next selection will make some changes.For now it is impossible to win with this team.Dhawan should be replaced with another opener,bring in hard hitting allrounder like Hardik Pandya for next ODI series,Add new fast bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah or any other new talented fast bowlers.

Its time for Dhoni to hang his boots. It a utter shame to see the way he handles his players these days. He has been critical of certain players like Rahane, Umesh, Ashwin in public and the same players have been match winners for Kohli in the tests. He always has some excuse or the other and somehow he always makes sure no one questions his batting. Dhoni like Ponting was just lucky enough to have great players in his side when they started out as captains.

Giving Aspirin to a cancer patient is not going to cure the patient . In the first game , Dhoni blamed the spinners and now blames all bowlers . In both matches , his entry retarded the scoring rate and the team was denied scores of 330 to 340 runs . Ishant has played nearly 150 international matches and he has still not learnt to avoid no balls and wides . Bhubaneswar has at least got control but Ishant is good for nothing . The day is not far off when he is going to blame Rohit for scoring a century of 90 or so balls instead of 70 balls . Get rid of Dhoni. Again , some youngster can be tried in place of Dhawan , who tries to play too many shots before getting set and throws his wicket . He does not value his wicket .

Btw... Glad Rohit didn't walk. Don't blame him one bit. But like I said before vast majority of first class cricketers don't walk and almost none walk every time. So this might stop at least some laying blame at the Aussies.

India need atleast a couple of bowlers who can bowl with an economy of no more than 4 runs an over. At the moment , there is no control at all, all the bowlers are going at 6-7 runs an over. The other thing is the bowlers are not taking enough wickets, absence of a quality leg spinner is another issue. It is very difficult to understand why Mishra is not in the team. Jadega and Ashwin are not effective in Australian conditions and should not be in the team.

Although the script played very similar to the last ODI this was a much more demoralising result for India. Firstly 309 is the highest chase at the Gabba and 308 at the Gabba is the equivalant to 330 at the WACA. Impressed by the majority of the batting and appauled at the second rate bowling.

Give Nathan Lyon a crack, he deserves it. He could do just as good or if not better than most of the quicks on the flat pitches. And if you get a pitch that spins India will have an advantage if Australia only use Maxwell. Both captains in both games seem content in letting the batsman build their innings with not much pressure or trying something creative due to confidence in the quality of their batsman. Now that we are 2 nil up bring in Hazelwood, Lyon, Sean Tait and go for the kill. Tait will scare the crap out of the Indians, he bowled some nasty stuff in the bbl. Keep rotating the other bowlers in and out of the team. Make them compete for the other bowling places in the team. They will be better for it.

Amazing how much criticism there always is for the losing team. From an Aussie viewpoint I don't think India are poor. We have just done a few little things better. Fielding and running between wickets and a bit better at reigning it back a bit even if the India batsmen get on top.  Perhaps a bit better tactics and maybe a half extra bowling option. It all adds up. But it's always the same mass hysteria for the losing team... No matter which team it is.

Do us a favour Australians. Kindly finish your chases like what NZ did against SL.. Atleast that will please Indian fans as well coz we are literally fed up criticising our bowling.. I don't think any team can win with such bowlers..

Very ordinary bowing in the middle over. Spinning option is not working in the flat wicket. Dhoni's captaincy is also very poor.

The sad part is that because Dhoni won India the 20/20 WC once and the ODI WC in 2011, no one wants to remove him from captaincy. His luck has run out and it is no surprise that India is losing so regularly in Australia. Rohit Sharma should be made the captain for the 2019 world cup. It is possible that if this is done Rohit might also deliver in Tests. Cricket is a strange game and strange things happen. At one time no one would have imagined Dhoni resigning from Tests in the middle of a series or lose a ODI series against South Africa at home. He has no strategy except to look his part as Captain Cool. Sandip Patil and co must have a re-look at Dhoni's appointment as Captain for the next 20/20 WC. With players like Pandya, Iyer Nitesh Rana and Unmukht India has a fair chance. Let the selectors not botch it up with Dhoni as the captain. Rohit Sharma is most suited for the shorter formats as of now. He is a good tactician as well as Ricky Ponting revealed some time ago.

Australia is showing India that they're not even in the same class as them. Ashwin who first of all should be reported for action is a third class bowler outside of India. India is proving to everyone that they can only win at home by continuing to lose away from the sub continent. I hope Australia whitewashes the Indians in the odis and t20s. I also believe that even if India makes 400 runs by batting first, Australia will chase that total down easily because of poor Indian bowling. Dhoni definitely has lost his mojo

OMG What is happening to India on overseas sporting turfs. The king of dust bowl can't buy a wicket as it seems. Now we can understand the Saffers were robbed of any quality cricket by making sub standard 3 day tracks that made Ashwin and Jadeja look like Shane Warne. Pathetic to say the least.

Really sorry for this poor fellow Rohit sharma. Many cricket pundits and fans always  target him unnecessarily. I was shocked to see dhoni's captaincy and post match presentation now a days. He is not accepting his mistake but giving so many excuses. You have a good  seam bowling allrounder in the team but in aus condition like brisbane and perth you are playing with 2 spinners. Either you remove Ashwin who is ineffective in both the matches or Jadeja who is not good at all in these conditions. Why B.Kumar did not play this match is out of thought. Ishant sharma is not a wicket taking bowler and he did not have enough match practice before this match. Yadav bowled one good over then Dhoni replaced him with spinner. Surprise!Rahane is a good batsman but there is a difference between a good batsman and big hitting or strike rotating batsman and Rahane is not at all a big hitting player as a result it affected so much rohit sharma's batting and strike rate of 100 is not enough in slog ove

Cant agree with Dhoni about bowlers. For this pitch and for this Australian team, 300 totals are not enough. We should give enough total to bowlers according to pitch and opponents so that bowlers can defend. For these two pitches, definitely we should have scored more than 330.

Just noticed. India bowled 11 wides &amp; 1 no ball which means we have awarded 24 runs to the opposition. 12 extra runs + 12 extra bowls to score freely from. This is unacceptable at any level. Ishant Sharma bowled 8 wides. Australia in comparison with their B attack bowled 7 wides. Cannot blame everything on Dhoni when bowlers are profligate! It is also true that not many teams can score as fluently as India does against Australia.

Rohit Sharma. What a player.  He's probably close to tearing his hair out wondering what he has to do to get his side a win but he's a wonderful ODI batsman. One of these days we might get him out early but I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for it.

Why exactly did Australia invite India to play the ODI series? Shouldn't they have been playing against the West Indies? Atleast the West Indies would have been more entertaining, if not more challenging. Its not that Australia are full strength either. I wonder what paying spectators feel about this ordinary bit of cricket being played  especially in the bowling and fielding departments.

Stop getting so emotional everyone ! Im a staunch Aussie fan don't get me wrong, but Indian fans are so hard on their team.  Fast, bouncy wickets that need strong back foot play and the bowlers quickly learning to bowl a different length.  And playing a team coming off in Big Bash mode. All credit to the Indians playing on the WACA and Gabba and scoring 300 plus. The next 3 tracks will be much more to their liking and the results may show. Massive kudos to Sharma, Smith and Bailey so far - bowlers on both teams need some improvement.

I am an Indian supporter and I am not unhappy that India have lost. Let Australian whitewash in both ODI and T20 and may be then the selectors would think of change of guard. MDS served well India for years and now the time has come to hand over the batten to the next generation. In the last couple of years there is nothing new or different MSD had tried, the same old players adn the same defensive cricket. I am rather happy India lose but learn by playing aggressive cricket. And I cant understand how can he keep selecting Jadeja outside India.

Its harsh to blame Indian bowlers. Aussies did nothing better either with the ball on both games. It was another slow ton by RSharma on a flat track and his record is getting better. On the other hand Indian ODI record every since he started to open the innings is getting worse. Another 20 runs could have saved both ODI's for India.

Australia is so far ahead of the next team it is not even funny. They have the best backup teams especially for their type of conditions. And Smith must be in love with India! Pak/SL are more likely to defend 300 scores than Indians &amp; it appears to be a psychological thing. Another set of data points to too frequent meetings between India &amp; Australia in pro-Oz conditions where India has come second-best most of the time leading to negative mindset. What we Indians can feel good about is our batting strength. It is not easy to score 300 against ANY Australian team. They are so competitive. But I must say that India is better off in chasing during the next few matches. Our last year's chases got derailed due to Johnson/Starc's brilliance which is not the case anymore! Well done Australia &amp; India too. Both games went on till last few overs. And yes too much vitriol against India in these forums (mostly by Indians themselves). Guys be balanced. We are dealing with World Cup champions!

Easy chase yet again, remrakable how ineffective indian spinners are in two games, same old indian theme of Indian team loosing abroad with such ease. Dhoni misread the pitch and did not set enough target. Grounds are big and lot of twos and three will do the job without taking risks, India did not attack much in batting in both games. 350 might not be big score for Aussies batting in such good form.

300 runs in any pitch is considered good score ,if blower can't able to take wicket in middle overs then its blower problem not the captain. Only change need to be done in remaining ODI is Dhawan.Either Aus win the series by 4-1 or 3-2.

Its clear Dhoni needs to go.. Doesnt have any imagination as a captain.When things go wrong or Teams bowling cant make any difference he needs to change something,ask bowlers to go round the wicket,give them some confidence,set some field changes.I refuse to believe Indian Bowlers are the problem.The only and the major one problem is MS Dhoni.He needs to go as soon as possible.

i thank msd for whatever he has contributed to our indian cricket for the past decade.. but i seriously think his time is up.. may be a few catches could have been taken, rubbish captaincy, poor death batting(esply by dhoni), poor fielding efforts, extremely pedestrian bowling line-up, good flat wickets have led to our downfall, may be dhoni can rest himself for the rest of the series &amp; test the bench..! :/ drop dhawan, bring in rishi dhawan, make manish pandey the opener.. -_-

With Dhoni it is always about combination (which is picks wrongly). I am sure after losing series in next match he will get the combination right. For Aus we need more all rounder. For next match (If India wants to win), Take S Dhawan, R Ashwin, Yadav out and get Gurkeerat, R Dhawan, Bhuvi in team! believe me it will make combination right and more option in bowling!

For the second time India was 30 to 40 runs short.  It is harder for visiting teams to set a target in ODI games specially at the WACA and the Gabba. Chasing is the better option for India  if the toss is won in the next game. Wonder if Rohit Sharma / Kohli partnership produced the desired scoring rate.  Dudley Gunasena, Eastwood, NSW, Australia.

Indian selectors must decide on MSD's future in ODI team. He simply has lost his Midas touch. Awful and uninspiring as captain. How long we will keep picking players like Jadeja and Dhwan!! Hope India loses 5-0 and we see fresh ideas and newer set up for ODIs. BCCI please hire a good fast bowling coach too...

Hope India loses 5-0 and we see fresh ideas and newer set up for ODIs. BCCI please hire a good fast bowling coach too...

dhoni is pathetic captain. he is not at all communicating with his fast bowler. you have tell your bowlers on field what to do when and that is where experience of captain matters. forget plans on paper.

time for the captain to sit and analyse ... but if the captain has to analyse himself ... its never going to happen with Dhoni... both the matches we were short of 15 to 20 runs....
1st match 41st to 45th over - 30 Balls 32 runs...
2nd match 43rd to 47th over - 24 balls 23 Runs...
on both counts Dhoni was at the crease ... instead of going for bit hits with 8 wickets in hand dhoni is trying for ones and two....
Is dhoni trying to save his place and grace ???? time to think..

Very enjoyable. India are totally incapable of doing well in Australia. Their "fans" will say the same of Australia but dont forget Australia have won world cups home and away. 1983 does not count. Long time ago and they were lucky. India prepares favourable wickets on small grounds. Their fans fill up the stadiums (not for tests of course) and the home side is always favourite. Not a true indication of skill. I was particularly please that Rohit did not walk for a much more obvious snick than Baileys in the last match. I thought only Australians were bad sports. I hope that Australia wins the next game so they can rest everyone before the NZ return series. I would love to see India beaten by a fourth or fifth string Indian side.

Good that we pulled them back after what appeared to be a 330-340 chase.
Now I am concerned about how we would defend a score of 300 when it comes
to it.  Are these bowlers upto it ?

I think the worrying signs for India is that Australia are doing it easy. You need to tweek your plan. Australia struggled early around 4 per over why wouldnt you try and bring fielders in at this point build more dot balls and perhaps grab a wicket (but having said that they created the chances and splashed them). At the moment India are letting AUstralia score runs to easily and need to tweek something. I find the negative mindset of most captains makes run scoring easy, just cos your allowed 4 fielders out doesnt mean you have to have 3 players out.

Let India lose 5-0 ,next series we may see new players.If India wins atleast one match,then old players would be playing till Dhoni retires.Bumrah should have played instead of Bhuvi,and Hardik Pandiya should have been added in ODI also.Pandya is in great form  at present.Why wait till T20 for Pandya arrival to Austrailia

India should have defended this total today. They didnt take their catches at perfect time. The ground size was big and runs were not easy to come by. opening partnership took the game away from India. Dhoni's odi captaincy will now be in the line for all remaining games.

Dhoni has to remove dhawan and bring any new players with rahane as opener. remove umesh and bring back bhuvanesh. series lost so better play for pride with youngsters. if Dhoni can't make changes bCCI  has to remove Dhoni.

Same highlights of the last game!! Aus has nothing to do if Indian bowlers have no clue how to bowl in Aus!! Not understanding why again two spinners on flat track??? Ashvin is not require at all 60 runs no wicket!!! Better to have Bhuvi, Ishant, Yadav, Sran. Very bad bowling by India and there is no chance for India, and cricket looks so boring credit to worst Indian bowlers having no cricketing sense which line what ball and do not have ability to bowl yorkers!! Now go with all youngsters to have chance atlest rather going for same team!!!!! Ashvin should be sit out now onward and never ever dare to go to Aus with poor bowling and wasting India's winning positions!! What a selfish bowler!!! Even Jadeja not atall looking effective and seems to have t20 medium pacer Hardik Pandya or Binny require. Raina, Yuvraj, Bhajjee badly missing!!!!!

For a change how about we take these second rate Aus bowlers and let Aus use our first rate Indian bowlers? May be we will have a chance? BCCI should force Aus to grant Jadeja Aus citizenship and I want Aus to include Jadeja for next 6-7 years in ODI so that it will restore some balance between teams.

Blaming Dhoni, which seems to be an inevitability, will do no good. No good at all. While he's not the force he used to be, he's not the reason India have been losing. There's clearly much more to it.

Another brilliant batting chase from the worlds #1 side. Can't understand at what stage a winning chase of 300+ gets boring to some. Great to watch a class side go through it's paces and all should enjoy.  The star of Steve Smith just continues to rise and he is definitely the worlds premier all-forms batsman. George Bailey is at the top of his game also and it's very hard to see how any side can stop the rampaging world champions. India are going to have to bowl and field a lot better than this to seriously challenge.

Another good win by AUS. Indian bowling is not capable of defending even 350 runs. 
I don't know why is Dhawan included in the team on foreign tours. He is just a good batsmen for sub-continent pitches.

This is frustrating cricket. I feel sorry for the bowlers, for both the teams. They come hard at the batsmen only to be clobbered away for fours and sixes, on wickets that offer almost nothing. They remind me of the cement tracks cricket is played on at the high school level. Honestly, seeing as home conditions have become integral to the sport, I would not be surprised to find some hostile turning tracks this World T20. As incorrect as that may be, this seems to be the new turn cricket, in general, has taken.

Australia win with 7 wickets still in hand. Once again the run chase was easy, Australia never looked like being in trouble. 
The only thing India will win on this tour is the toss. So far they are two for two on the toss.
The press conference will be interesting to see if India complain about DRS or anything else. That's not up to their satisfaction.

@SCOOBY_007 exactly mate. SA were scoring 350-400 on those Indian pitches. Anyway, I have Bailey as my MOM for both the 1st and 2nd of these ODIs. He pulled Australia to the win on both occasions. I don't see how Nohit is in consideration at all, but I suppose he did score runs, albeit at a pedestrian pace.

I am sorry, but as an Indian fan, I have to say that these defeats are getting way beyond embarrassing. This is just Aus A team remember, and they are hammering us left and right. Indian fans since 2011 have had to endure a series of humiliating whitewashes. Seriously, how many self-respecting countries would have allowed their captain, selection committee etc to continue after just 1-2 whitewashes?? We have allowed Dhoni to be the undisputed king. Selection committee is not answerable to anyone and they can also do whatever they want and get away with it. Pathetic state of affairs.

Many reasons of india losing this match.. 1st Poorest captaincy by dhoni. 2nd Team playing combination especially so much trust on spinners.3rd. Lack of big hitters towards the end overs. You guys may not like me saying this statement but Rahane actually does not deserve in odi team. There are many players in domestic who can score briskly in odi than rahane. Pls. go thru the domestic competitions you will find. Rahane may have done strike rate of 100 but was putting unnecessary pressure on rohit and other batsmen.

If a team cannot defend 300 plus so many times, the bowling unit is toothless. Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma , Ashwin and Jadeja have been playing cricket for years international level. Can't put two consecutive balls on a spot. Nowhere to hide under excuses. But, with the quality of players available at hand almost all of the bowlers in domestic have no quality. So, we are done for basically.

Australia XI ODI experience equates to 417 games; whereas, India XI ODI experience equates to 1072 games - not even half. Embarrassing stuff that India cannot win games or more importantly a series against Australia in Australia despite playing there more often than not. India just don't have the fast bowlers to succeed there. Ashwin is clearly showing that he struggles to bowl away from the subcontinent - I thought he has improved or does he need conditions to suit him? the ODI rule changes have not really made much if a difference it seems.

Australia are batting well. Bailey just hit a six. Should be a similar result as the first game. 
I wonder if India win a game on this tour. They were only in Australia for a tour before the World Cup and lost every game in all forms of cricket to Australia.

India 20 runs and two good bowlers short every time they play in Aus. Making Bailey look like Steve Waugh. This looks like it's going to be another 5-0.

Extremely disappointed with our bowling today.. I thought after easily conceding 310 in last game they will come hard today but they just don't seem to have any idea what to do.. Once I saw srinath, kumble &amp; harbhajan concede easily 280+ in a match against SA but it stung that so much that they came back strongly in next match to successfully defend 220 odd score.. Current bowlers with every help at their disposal and even after having played for nearly 5 years(all of them) &amp; 8 years(ishant) barring only Sran... I have been a staunch critic of MSD's captaincy but even great Captains like Lloyd, Imran, Mark Taylor could have been able to do anything with these guys.. No point in blaming our batsmen to fall 20-25 runs short again as 309 is a good enough total too.. Similarly no point in having tete-a-tete with AUS supporters till our bowling does anything worthwhile... :(

Extremely disappointed with our bowling today.. I thought after easily conceding 310 in last game they will come hard today but they just don't seem to have any idea what to do.. Once I saw srinath, kumble &amp; harbhajan concede easily 280+ in a match against SA but it stung that so much that they came back strongly in next match to successfully defend 220 odd score.. Current bowlers with every help at their disposal and even after having played for nearly 5 years(all of them) &amp; 8 years(ishant) barring only Sran... I have been a staunch critic of MSD's captaincy but even great Captains like Lloyd, Imran, Mark Taylor could have been able to do anything with these guys.. No point in blaming our batsmen to fall 20-25 runs short again as 309 is a good enough total too..

I disagree with those saying Jinx should be dropped. He was scoring at run a ball. He was rotating the strike in middle overs and hit boundaries when needed. Sure he's not someone who can effortlessly clear the boundary like Rohit or Kohli, but he has timing to find boundaries. The guys you should be criticising are Dhawan and Dhoni.

Commentators just said Indian bowlers have conseeded 1000 runs in the last 3 ODI's. I don't what people expect from the flat pitches on offer for the seamers.

Given another catch going undetected will Dhoni again be pressing for better decisions from the umpires?

Opening bat, scored a ton with 11 4s and 3 6s still strike rate is under 100! what a player. Ever since RSharma started opening, his record is awesome, India's record is terrible.

India on course for another demoralising loss - despite posting a 300+ score. Obviously this is down to our poor bowling but then MSD keeps on picking the wrong bowlers - when is he going to realize that pitches down under are not generally spin-friendly? Maybe after we are 0-3 down &amp; series is already lost! Why is Dhawan keep on being picked - when he has shown no form for quite a while now. Hope Rohit's critics are going to now permanently keep quiet but unbelievable some are having a go at Rahane today despite his 89 at a s/r of over 100.

Rohit Sharma is the first away batsmen to have scored ODI hundreds against Australia in Australia in 3 different venues(Melbourne,Perth,Brisbane),and only 2nd batsmen after Viv Richards to have 3 ODI hundreds against Australia in Australia,but spare of thought for him.While Viv won all his 3 matches when he scored those hundreds for WI against Australia,Rohit has lost in his previous 2 matches with India when he scored a ton and looks likely to be the 3rd such ocassion.He may yet walk away with the motm,but he wished he had some venomous pace bowling teammates in his team which Viv had.You can score 400 in pacy and bouncy wickets of Australia,South Africa,but If your pacers can't hunt in packs and take wickets in regular intervals,your totals will likely be chased as 1 or 2 set batsmen can do all the damage for your team while chasing.It was Gibbs&amp;Smith who did all the damage while chasing Australia's world record 438 in Jo'burg even though Bracken had a 5 wicket haul for Australia.

Good catch by Rahane but a little too late. India's fielding has been terrible at crucial times - Ishant dropping a dolly, Ashwin not getting behind the ball with Marsh half way down the pitch, bowlers not cutting singles off their own bowling. This is going to be another demoralising loss.

I don't understand how so many Indians blame Dhoni and the bowling. What makes you think you have the bowlers at all to defend anything? That's really what I don't understand. Unless the opposition has an off day with the bat, India's only chance to win is to bat the opposition out of the game. Dhoni does not have the bowlers in the team, nor in reserve (from what I've ever seen of Indian bowling in the IPL) with the pace or skill to choose from. Therefore, it make no sense to blame Dhoni. Blame your batsman who simply are not putting the score on the board to bat the opposition out of the match on a consistent basis.

Australia well on their way to an easy win despite 308 runs scored by India.  Dhoni's bowling moves (taking out spinners when they were keeping the run-rate down and introducing the almighty Yadav) have lost what appeared to be a game that India could have won.  Definitely an 8-0 drubbing with Dhoni in charge.  Please retire Dude.   And BTW - your batting today was weak just like the past 2 years and it cost India another 20-30 runs.  Thanks Captain Cool!?  This is disgusting to watch as an Indian cricket fan.

Dhoni takes off the spinners when they're going well and replaces with Yadav. Also too many runs given after drinks break. Dhoni has to go now! I'm tired of his brain dead captaincy! If sports is a job and thus about results, then Dhoni should've been sacked a long time ago. In fact, everyone should be sacked.

We will lose this in 45 overs, but seriously No 5,6,7 position in Indian batting lack a genuine hitter. Dhoni WAS a great finisher a few years back not anymore. Its amusing how all the commentators call his wicket important and the words " dangerous hitter".

I see no sense in people blaming Rahane. India getting 300+ is a good enough achievement considering the recent change in the ODI rules, and he (Rahane) played a major part in it by maintaining a strike rate above 100. What more can you ask for from a player who has readily accepted any position he has been asked to play at? Besides the real problem is the placid pitch and the fact that Dhoni insists on sticking to a sub-part bowling combination, instead of reading the pitch and the conditions right.
</p>
<p>
Maybe Australia will win; but not coz of the lack of runs posted on the board, but because we don't have the right combination of penetrative bowlers to make inroads into a batting line-up that is not Australia's first choice combination.

Joapp no it was not because of him we are at leadt in 308. Kohli and rohit did the job. Because of him we were down to 308 when score should be reading 350. He couldn't even hit full tosses so stop backing him. He is not a no4 batsman so play him as an opener or drop him. We are done watching rahane bringing the team down, it happened too many times to forgive.

Dhoni has been playing tip and run cricket ever since 2011 world cup win, but blind fans and star sports commentators had been continuing to hype him as the "best finisher in the game" regardless. But now with Srinivasan gone from BCCI, Dhoni's days are numbered as well. Problem is that Dhoni has left the team with no good talent at all. Batting and bowling both look very very weak whether test, ODI or T20. India has been getting whitewashed left and right, but it's hard to deny that far worse days lie ahead for Indian cricket !!

Rahane and rohit should open and dhawan should be dropped. Or else drop both rahane and dhawan but please stop sending rahane at no 4. He is not a no 4 batsman. Rohit,rahane,virat,pandey,dhoni,gurkreet,jadeja,rishi,sran,yadav,ishanth. With this we can have 3 all rounders and 6 bowling options. In india you can bring ashwin in the place of rishi and we can become a complete solid team with an extra bowling option. Right now we are doomed with rahane as no4.

Oneday pitches have been flat for years. T20 has made batsman much more capable in oneday particularly 100 runs last 10 overs nott much of an issue. So not sure why we are complaining about the pitches. As for walking noone walks these are not isolatwd incidences and why should they walk. We have umpires to control that

Can't believe some people blaming Rahane. The guy played at more than 110 strike rate. The problem is that Dhoni and Raina game is quite suited to flat and slow wickets. Raina nowadays struggles against even mediocre bowlers bowling bouncer. No proper spinners in Australia which Raina can take on. Boundaries unlike ipl aren't small. Raina would struggle to get 30 here with less than 80 strike rate

Aus are doing these because smith Warner etc are not technically correct plays they capitalise on bad bowling or flat pitches if there is something in the pitch then they will get out which is badesigned for aus and if rohit played in aus against that west indies team I would have seen 400 record broken just to make their batsmen look better but when they come to India and if pitches are like that they were against sa then they would get all out below 50 or even less

Aus are doing these because smith Warner etc are not technically correct plays they capitalise on bad bowling or flat pitches if there is something in the pitch then they will get out which is badesigned for aus and if rohit played in aus against that west indies team I would have seen 400 record broken just to make their batsmen look better but when they come to India and if pitches are like that they were against sa then they would get all out below 50 or even less
</p>, <p>
<p>
This looks like a 350 wicket. India lost too many wickets scoring too few runs in the final overs. Looks like the thought/knowledge that no amount of runs are enough with our bowling attack got to them. I don't see India getting Smith out on this pitch.

Today no specialist(so called) ODI Indian batsmen scored (at least who made 15 runs) with the S/R of over 100 except that guy who has been branded as not suitable for ODI by his struggling captain.

Wow rohit must be the 2nd best ODI batsman in form behind Ab who is miles ahead simple because Ab has many gears while rohit has a few and his singles taking skills lack a lot. ....but he is all class

Left wondering at the end of another Dhoni-Led Indian innings:
</p>
<p>
1. Why on this planet Dhoni is coming ahead of a specialist batsman when there are hardly a few overs left? He is no way a power hitter as he used to be. He is struggling to hit a boundary off even a bad ball these days. What worse a specialist batsman will do if he is allowed to come ahead of Dhoni himself ? Atleast a specialist batsman can hit a few boundaries, if not more !!
2. What is Ravindra Jadeja doing in these conditions !! He cant even SWING his bat to the last ball of the innings !!! So so disheartening to see the shots he tried in the final few balls. Dont we have ANYONE better than HIM?
3. Is trying a cheeky shot a fashion now a days ?
4. Did any Rohit-basher miss Rohit towards the final overs today ??? 
5. Is this the best India could do out of so many years of IPL ? What a waste !
6. Could someone please do a miracle and get Dhoni to step down so that some new faces can be tried before world cup ???

C'mon guys, don't you see how that proved the BCCI point. The Indian batsman was proved not out by the umpire. DRS should show that this was the case also, but snicko got it wrong. These sort of errors by the technology show that the only way to get the right decision is to pressure the umpires to make the right decision. There was apparently enough pressure today for the umpire to make the right decision. Good work from the umpires and it was only possible because of the BCCI refusal to use faulty technology. ;-)

Why do we have two Ds in the team still? Dhawan and Dhoni have no place in the XI. It is high time Dhoni is handed his Lifetime Achievement Award.

Amidst all the finger pointing, dhawan seems to be largely escaping criticism which should have come his way long back. He has been the weak link for quite some time, barring the odd decent performance, and should have been dropped much earlier.

Looks like India have missed out again on a decent score. Don't seem to have what it takes to accelerate in the final overs. Should have scored at least 350 - 360 today.

It would have been brilliant to see AB De Villiers down there in the last 10 overs. Probably would have taken the score past 400. 308 is a nothing score after that kind of a start. I can see the match ending in 45 overs.

Wrong team composition is hurting India time and again. Rahane is never a slogger , but he can rotate strike and score at a decent nick. In my opinion, India should replace the struggling Dhawan with Rahane at the top. That also opens a middle order slot for Gurkeerat who is a good finisher and a backup spinner which India seriously needs in the absence of Raina.  Replace Jadeja at 7 by Rishi Dhawan. Two spinners on the Australian pitches is a luxury (unless it is Sydney) which India can hardly afford at the moment.

yes,i totally agree that rohit sharma should have walked the moment he nicked the ball behind.such things are not acceptable in a game of cricket.i criticized bailey and I would criticize rohit too.also what a disgrace as a  batsman shikhar dhawan,dhoni,ashwin and jadeja are.these guys have just forgotten how to bat,how to hit the ball hard and how to score runs.dhoni and dhawan both are becoming just a useless bunch of guys who are good for nothing.we should have easily scored 330 and just like the game in perth ended up atleast 20 runs short.

It looks like Indians are 100 runs short of a decent total on this flattest of flat wicket. With an inexperienced bowlers and formidable and deep-running opposition batters, only a very bad performance from Australia can save them.

What India lacking is a Yuvraj at the end and a sehwag at the top in ODI's. Not saying Yuvraj should be in team but definitely no one even closer to Yuvi's Calibre. Raina not even a distant close. Unless Dhoni gives chance to youngsters we will never know what we have in the bag. With 4 years from world cup no need to drop but atlas try someone else instead of Dhawan. The number of youngsters who travelled with the team in the last 4 years without a game even in inconsequential games is astounding. Definitely the reason why selectors did not select Raina. Atleast, Rahane is back in the team saved from a confused captain. Thanks to selectors again for making Rahane the captain for zim tour and sending a strong message.

I will be surprised, but very happy, if India win this game. Normally, a flat track is a flat track for both the teams in the ODIs. Unless, Indian bowlers bowl exceptionally well, Aussies should win this one as well. But, I will be very happy if our team India wins.

Sick of watching Dhoni Struggle , the middle order fail to accelerate. Why are these mustakes made again and again. Its not about India winning or losing, its about the thoughtlessness of the entire process.  Its silly to blame Rahane, his strike rate was more than 100. He is not a power hitter. Power hitter has to be at No 6 and No 4. 
If Rahane was not involved in that partnership, India would have made 270.  Anyways Aus will win in 45 overs this time.

Good start wasted again. How long we will keep playing Jadeja in overseas tours? Why India are not picking Rishi Dhawan in his place?? Rishi is more than decent bat and a good line length bowler too. Time up for Dhoni as captain and player. He should retire gracefully. India will lose this one too..........Indian Fan

The winning team made 3 changes and we are stuck with the same team almost. Dhoni is very very rigid and is not ready to give chances to anyone. Gurkeerat has been with Team India since past 6 ODI's but somebody like Manish Pandey gets chance straightaway. Just Imagine what would have Gurkeerat felt. Honestly, i believe Dhoni will ruin team India. Look at past 4-5 years - India has not produced a single world class player except Kohli. The other 2 best - Pujara and Rahane were not considered good at some point in time in test and Rahane in Bangladesh, respectively. Dhoni has never tried anyone except Jadeja in the allrounder role. I respect Dhoni a lot but at the same time mate - you need to give way to others if you are not doing justice. Ganguly produced players like - Yuvraj, Zaheer, Harbhajan, Nehra, Sehwag and even he gave chances to you to but up the order in your early days. Mr. Dhoni - please give opportunities to others.

@Marcio - Keep crying. It would be nicer if India won this one then you will get more chance to cry. You were no where to be seen when Bailey was reprieved and went on  to score 130 odd runs. Rohit only added 30 more runs after being reprieved so India still at a disadvantage after those two howlers.

Rahane's 89 was very good. He doesn't have classy strokes like Kohli or Rohit but he plays very effectively. And so unselfish too! You could have fully expected that Dhawan or Rohit would have slowed the tempo to get from 89 to 100. But not Rahane - he put the team first.

INDIA is not gonna win unless they throw away S.Dhawan. Before I say this am an ardent Dhoni fan and its disheartening to see the way he is struggling to hit big shots, time for him to say goodbye to the sport that gave him all.Sad that he didn't have an fairy tale end to his marvellous career. He is also stubborn with his tactics, which also once helped INDIA lift world trophies but I don't think it would happen anymore.

that's they need raina in the team that can hit boundaries as soon as he steps in the crease. especially during the last 5 overs. he doesn't takes time to settle in.

Again poor finish from India, these days the final 5-10 overs are the most important and can change the game. You can go from looking from a poor total to ending up with a big score, or on target for 300 then ending on 350.

I have never seen such inert batting in the death overs by any side, including the minows, what India showed today. All the money from IPL is being wasted if the best you produce for death overs is Pandey and Jadeja. What a disaster. India deserves to loose this game.

I do agree with other posts that 2 spinners on Aussie wickets makes no sense.  With that said, India might win this one since they have scored over 300 again.    Wait, just woke up from my dream and found out that India have lost another one with the 2 spinners conceding 150 runs for no wickets.....

AUS fought back &amp; frankly speaking, bowled REALLY Well to restrict INDIA to 308 when it could have been 325-330.. Since its another flat track, I think our bowlers should try &amp; emulate how they bowled in last 15 overs.. Ashwin &amp; Jadeja should think their life depends on it because only then perform better..!! &amp; a request to our fielders, pls don't stay put far behind to concede easy singles because that's the life line of any batting no matter how aggressive they bat.. If need be, please disobey MSD ;-) :-)
Hope we win, not just being patriot but also to ensure series remains alive..!!!

This is really pathetic cricket, IND should have got to 320 minimum, please drop Rahane from 4 bcoz of him others cant play. He should either open the batting or warm the bench. I hope India should loose. Dhoni should have come in at 4 it would have made a big difference.

Yeah everybody other than india loves rahane because he wins matches for you. When a set batsman cannot hit full tosses to boundary then he will bring the team down. Pandey should be send in no4 and gurkreet should replace rahane. This is the zillionth time rahane did this to india in odis. 350 to 309... Just perfect, thank you rahane... What a class act.

Grand total of 5 boundaries in the last 10 overs for India. They are messing up in the end overs and it might cost them a lot on these extremely flat pitches. I hope the next venue has some more competitive pitches that has something good for the bowlers.

Well, this game is definitely on Australia's bat. They can easily define their outcome I think. The only saving grace could be if the slower bowlers can get the odd ball to stop on the pitch; as was seen on few occasions with the back of hand ball from Faulkner.

I see the Oz doing it again.. God help the Indians.

But having said this, the Indian fans blaming Rohit for everything under the sun is uncalled for. If he bats fast and gets out, they say he wasted the opportunity. If he plays a dot, they say he is wasting balls. Every batsman knows what he goes through at the crease and what he is capable of going forward. You just can't blame the failure of your bowlers on the batsmen.
</p>
<p>
Some fans have also concluded that "Whenever he scores a ton, the team fails". That's very cynical.

Granted MSD is not in knick but he showed its not easy to just come in and accelerate. Even Pandey has struggled. Very few batsmen can hit boundaries from the first ball. Raina could and Jadeja can. This is why it is important for set batsman to finish the job.

Rahane already consumed two wickets. How many times did we see this? How many times did he make india sink when we are sailing high? Please drop rahane from odis. India looked at a score of 350 easy and now 320 looks difficult. Rahane indeed plays like dravid, that is the exact reason why we dont need him in odis.

No body walks these days. Did Bailey walk. I am afraid we don't have the bowling attack to contain the Aussies unless it spins. Dhoni please have some confidence in Umesh , attacking and taking wickets is the only option on these flat decks.

ROHIT Sharma was gifted a life on 89 not out when an umpiring howler missed a chunky outside edge that sailed to wicketkeeper Matt Wade off the bowling of quick Joel Paris.
Sharma attempted to drive a ball that was slightly too short and snicked behind the wicket.
Unfortunately, umpires Richard Kettleborough and Simon Fry missed the clear edge and judged Sharma not out.
India's refusal to accept the Decision Review System (DRS) means it is not being used during this ODI series.
It comes just one match after Aussie George Bailey appeared to be caught off a glove edge in the series opener, but was judged not out.
This one was a much greater piece of umpiring incompetence

Bailey's was a tough call. Umpire wasnt sure. Benefit of the doubt went to the batsman. Sharma's was clearly out, and the only explanation is the pressure India puts on umpires. This is what Dhoni means when he says "We must ensure umpires make the right decision."

What kind of umpiring is this? Rohit was clean out and even I heard a touch while watching LIVE. It was more clear than that of Bailey. As an Indian fan, I am disappointed with this kind of umpiring. The umpiring standards are at stake now. Some can say it is part of game but no, it is not. Rohit should have walked off.

India is doing a mistake by playing Ishant in ODI's, Ishant is finally peaking in tests and demonstrating the potential and consistency which marked him for great things. He has always been a cannon fodder in short form cricket as well he might lose his length required for Test cricket. He should be preserves for Test cricket and maybe once he becomes more matured as a test bowler, he may start playing ODI's.

I have watched the likes of Manjrekar, Amre, Shastri play lousy ODI cricket and IND would struggle to reach 220 in each game. Then it transformed under Sachin over 20 years to make getting to 300 easy peasy. He would totally "own" the middle overs and rotate with ease. This eventually in the 2000s was well supported up top by Sourav, Viru, Gambi and in the middle by Yuvi, MSD, Raina. For me, the most disappointing and depressing fact is to see us back to the 80s cricket of mucking around in the middle overs. We dont need 4s and 6s guys, just 5 singles and if possible a boundary. Should be going at close 7 rpo in today's game and eventual target in range of 330-350. Thanks. good luck.

And need of the hour is to open with rahane.. We can't depend on rohit-virat combination in every match.. We are in desperate need of player like yuvraj in the middle order...

It's important for India to give chances to it's new players to understand where they stand in international cricket, which sadly does not happen under Dhoni. Mann has been with the team for 7 ODI's now without getting a look in. It would be great to see Rahane opening in next match in place of Shikhar, Mann going down at 6, Dhawan replacing one of Ashwin and Jadeja, and Axar replacing the other based on performance, and then Dhoni sticks with the new players for the remaining matches. Most of the other teams keep exploring new players in these not so important bilateral series barring India who seem to keep on playing Raina's, Ishant's, Jadeja's, Mohit's, Rohit's, Dhawan's (with due respect to these players performance in one format or the other) irrespective of conditions, match situations, win or lose. I can easily see Raina back in the fold without other players getting a decent enough opportunity to prove  themselves,

Playing shikhar dhawan is a lottery. He can hardly succeed in important matches. His technique is so faulty that even if he succeed in one or two matches can't be expected to score in crucial games. Poor imitation of Shewag. It is high time, the selectors look for a better reliable opener.

What is the problem with Dhoni..can't understand why he is reluctant to drop dhawan and jadeja. Neither Dhawan is a sehwag nor jadeja a yuvraj..it is good that selectors have dropped raina..otherwise we would have seen the same team. It's high time to think beyond dhoni..

As a neutral observer, I don't understand India's decision to bat first actually. Isn't India's perennial problem its inept pace bowling, so its batsmen never know how many runs on the scoreboard is enough to defend? And with Kohli being the King of the chase, I think India should be chasing.

So the most economical of the IND bowler from the last game dropped to accommodate Dhoni's CSK pals Ashwin and Jadeja?

Since spinners are not getting any purchase, he could have gotten Ishant or Rishi in place of Ashwin/Jadeja - but that would be unthinkable to Dhoni.

The pathetic thing is he can continue to play his spinner pals and lose 5-0 and can still be the captain for another 2 years. One series loss on a foreign land on such spinning pitches, Amla steps down - one would have expected something similar from Dhoni from 2011 ENG series but he continued to do the same for another 4 years.
</p>

So the most economical of the IND bowler from the last game dropped to accommodate Dhoni's CSK pals Ashwin and Jadeja?

Since spinners are not getting any purchase, he could have gotten Ishant or Rishi in place of Ashwin/Jadeja - but that would be unthinkable to Dhoni.

Yet again our capt wins the toss-2 in 2 now!Well,atleast can't blame luck-or lack of-for once.And for Aussies,looks like a good toss to lose for Smithie,again.Game went into 50 th in 1st game,don't think Aus will need anywhere as many to make it 2-0 here.

Hazlewood was the most economical of the Aussie frontline bowlers in Perth and Boland the most expensive. I know which one I would have "rested." Win the series first and then give Hazlewood a break, that should be they way to go.

It is amusing to note that most of the comments here from Indian fans focus on solutions like changing the batter order, dropping Dhoni etc. while the real reason for these two defeats is India's chronic problem with bowling. I am from Pakistan but I bear no ill will towards India (or any other country for that matter); but I really feel India has developed too much of a batting culture over decades, which is now letting them down AWAY FROM HOME. Just as Pakistan's problems lie in batting, India's lie in bowling. Just as it's disheartening for Pakistan bowlers to find their batsmen struggling to chase even modest totals OR posting modest totals to defend, it must be disheartening for India's batsmen to keep on posting 300 scores only to find their bowlers unable to defend. And no, 300 is still not an easily gettable total! The pressure of chasing is different and a good bowling side should be able to use that pressure to their advantage.

What a lovely rule change for Rohit. Another seemingly legitimate excuse to be selfish and guard his wicket until the very end and boost his stats, regardless of the cost to his team and country. How can any player in this day and age blame a bowler? There's NOTHING in short form pitches for bowlers. If they do well we should sing their praises and if they don't we should accept that as being the norm, because it is. Blaming them for not being magicians is just stupid. Batsmen failing on the other hand...

"When we bat we know that we are not too worried about the strike rate".. Mr Sharma, that's not smart cricket. Smart cricket is to keep rotating strike on every ball (at least try to) and when you get a bad one, hit a big one. You hit a six and then, defend 2-3 balls which you could have perfectly placed it for single. This is NOT test cricket. There needs to be some urgency like Kohli or Smith or Bailey. Even Sachin did that. He hardly had any dots but Rohit Sharma's innings always has plenty of dots. Don't know what he is thinking when he is playing those dots. You will not be able to make up for it in the end every time especially against good bowlers. This is common sense but our hero thinks he just needs to be there. There's no point in having the best technique in the world if you don't have the right attitude. Cricinfo, plz publish.

India needed 350 plus score on this flat wicket. The set batsmen failed to raise the run rate to right level when needed, specially in the last 20 overs. Both Sharma and Kohli needs to be blamed for it. There was no point in playing so slow with only one wicket lost at 30 over mark.

Antes - you comment about losing less wickets meaning India bowled better is totally incorrect. Cricket is a game where runs indicaye the winner. The fact that Australia won automatically indicates Australia bowled and batted better than India. additionally there is also syrong evidence in that India only lost 3 wickets in compiling the score leaning toward Australia doing s better job at containing batsmen than India. R.Sharmas comments about set batsmen goimg on with it are nothing geound breaking. Everyone knows that it is easier to play big shots when your eye is in as opposed to having to go from the start.

40 avg, 90 strike rate (last 2 years even better) but people always blame Rohit. he does not deserve a place in the test team given his test form, but ODIs? Not his fault that there is no pinch hitter like Yusuf Pathan (strike rate 118 in ODIs) at 6, it's the selectors fault. Maybe Rishi Dhawan can play pinch hitter and also bowl 6-10 overs. In India Jadeja can, but overseas, his bowling is mauled.

I think even 350 would not have been enough. The Aussies literally strolled their way to d total in d last 10 overs &amp; playing risk-free cricket in the middle overs. Ashwin &amp; Jadeja were stunned by the attacking batting of Smith &amp; Bailey. The pitch being flat didn't help either. Gabba will certainly be better than Perth as seen in d last  Tests played der

Rohit is trying to justify his stand of selfish batting at a time when he could have gone for broke and attempted 20-30 runs more on the total. If he himself agrees that even 340 is not safe nowadays (which is absolutely right), how come he never pushed hard enough to get beyond 309? Honestly, given the position we were in after 30 overs, even a semi-major screw up in attempting to score at a faster pace would have seen us getting somewhere in he range of 300.

There is no quality in this interview. With the new rule changes even a layman will know that one batsman has to stay longer and bat till the end. It is basic common sense.  Also, Rohit Sharma needs to stop playing the blame game for the loss by pointing fingers at the bowlers. I'm pleasantly shocked at the remarks made by him saying that you don't know what's a winning score when you bat first...There are two things here -
</p>
<p>
1. India won the toss, then why did we bat first?
</p>
<p>
2. After playing at an international level for almost 9 years if you can't read the pitch, know your weaknesses and opponents' strength to asses a good score that's appalling!!
</p>
<p>
IMO Rohit's slow strike rate is ONE of the many reasons why we lost this game. He has to be mature to take the blame on himself partly like Dhoni does usually when India have lost chasing due to his slow strike rate.

Rohit is effectively saying that if you win the toss in an ODI on a flat track, you should bowl first. Paraphrasing he's saying 'I batted perfectly given what I knew about the pitch at the time'. The logical conclusion is that you have to put the opposition in the position of working out what a par score is while building their innings, and avoid that situation yourself. Of course, a different interpretation is that he's simply justifying his innings from Tuesday where he basically batted India out of the match!

I reckon Rohit played well but lacked the fire power from others. If he can just keep the dot  ball habit to minimum..it would be then fantastic. hitting a six and then 3 dot balls kind of ruins it a bit. Also, i saw people commenting that he shold come middle as only he, kohli and dhoni can play big shots...i would say let him open as he is one of the better and consistent openers in recent times...dont play around with him now...its dhawan i would say should start scoring again thereby lessening the pressure on rohit. Its ironic how everyone blames the person who scored a hundred but not the one who is flops more than he scores

pathetic to see so many of our subcontinent fans being armchair experts and giving lame suggestions. It's not that hard to understand why they were over cautious in the middle. Obviously MSD is no more the reliable #6 that he was a 3 years back. Jinx is great, but uncertain of his hitting abilities and then you have got a new guy and long tail. India would not have got 310 at the end though I agree 10-15 runs more would have been scored. It was nevertheless a gem of an innings from Rohit.

I agree with everything Rohit said. Except one thing. Why on earth don't you look for singles?? One of the main reasons India lost was Rohit was not busy enough on a flat pitch in Perth. Several balls he just blocked. He could have easily played it with soft hands and taken a few more singles. If he had taken 15 more singles and Kohli 7-8 more singles then India could have scored 330 rather than 310 which was a par score for that pitch. That's what Bailey and Smith did. When they weren't hitting boundaries they were taking singles. No such urgency from Rohit and Kohli. India hit more 4s and 6s then Australia and still lost.

Poor sportmanship from Rohit Sharma. Playing the blame game on bowlers for the loss. I was laughing out loud as I read this article. He reckons that he can't predict a winniny score if you bat first. You guys

Sad to see so many Rohit bashing comments. Really happy the way he played. I am not a big fan of him but he has done exceptionally well in OneDays.. against always very good seam attack in the world. Just for the comparison sake, in terms of strike rate, both Baily &amp; Virat have been slower than Rohit &amp; Smith was few runs ahead. Had he lost his wicket after hundred same people would have cursed him for throwing wicket after getting set &amp; for not making it big. Aussies still the best fielding side in the world, there were never easy pickings. &amp; Seriously? 20-30 more runs would have made any difference anywhere in the game? Aussies needed hardly 6-7 runs per over in last 10 overs &amp; that tells the story. The core problem have (always) been in-effective spinners on Aussie pitches &amp; India missed the trick not having extra seamer as others really did a good job. Fact is also.. after Yuvi &amp; Raina, India didn't produce any good finisher, mainly after Dhoni's down graded batting ability.

Agree with the points Rohit has made with these exceptions : Firstly, the fact that we lost only 3 wickets &amp; the Aussies lost 5 means that we actually bowled better than them but you can argue that we did not score as fast as them OR you can say that their bowlers bowled better to contain our runs. Yes, when you bat first, you do not know what will be a good score but that is all the more reason to try and reach over 320 &amp; actually keep up a good scoring rate right from the beginning. As far as I am concerned, I would blame the Captain i.e. Dhoni, for this loss. A Captain has the job of setting his field to stop the flow of runs, especially batting 2nd and I feel this was not done successfully by Dhoni.

Agree that we need one set batsman in last 10 overs but that doesn't mean that u will not rotate strike in middle overs as rohit did on that day(after hitting boundary he plays dots consecutively) and also with 9 wickets in hand he could have gone for big shots after 30 overs if he gets out there is time for other batsman to set in.

This is why it's always great playing India. They seem to be obsessed by individual records over the benefit of the team. Aussies have always played with a team first mantra and 5 World Cups prove that to be the best way.

Ideally, I would like to see Rohit come into the innings around the 20-25 over mark. Play a role like Bailey did. This gives him a chance to get his 100 (if he really hurries towards the end) but also brandishes any ideas of him reaching for personal milestones like 150, 200. This also provides a better balance to the side imo. Based on recent form, we need somebody like Mayank opening. MSD is not upto much anyways, so he can stay at middle. So, likely balance could be: Mayank, Ajinx, Virat, Rohit, Manish, MS, Gurkee/Rishi, Ashwin, Umesh, Barinder, Ishant.

Rohit is right. The white ball does plenty in the right conditions. It's more about the conditions and pitch than the ball. Look a Starc and the NZ bowlers in WC especially in NZ.

I agre that scoring rate would've been better, but let's not forget Aussie fielding, They just bowled 3 ov of spin.. whereas India bowled 21 Ov.. On a pacer friendly pitch Spinners were ineffective and then the score doesn't matter! Even if it was 350 target Aussies would have scored accordingly...  As for my opinion Rohit/Kohli/Dhoni are the only capable players to clear the boundaries with 5 fielders outside. So, if you think Rohit shouldn't have wasted many balls upfront, I say there wouldn't have been a better partnership in the middle..Rahane might also find it rather difficult to play after 40 Ov, So Dhoni was partly correct when he promoted himself, but you can see even he couldn't match scoring rate of Rohit at the end... If we think of having Rohit bat in the middle order so as to score big in the last overs.. it would be catastrophic.. Not only Dhawan is out of form but Rohit will go back to his old ways of throwing away wickets. A new batsman can play big with a set batsman.

Rohit should make these big 150s in test matches where in ODIs he should try to score some quick runs. these big scores in team's defeat will not be good for team.

@HAMMADFAYYAZ got it absolutely right. Going by current standards and pitches 170 off 160 is Test match grade. For ODI it is too expensive for team. Well it just cost the team a match. Poor sportsmanship by Rohit Sharma.

Rohit's 150 or team's 350?? His scores often read 50 off 75, 60 off 84 balls etc. This offsets the team by about 25 balls which is too many in ODIs. This hurts the team - One the innings run rate and two the pressure building on the following batsmen, if it is a chase then it costs the match. 170 sounds good but coming at a whopping cost of 160 balls. It is another matter of course that he was trying to play for 150 and 200 in sight. Consider a hypothetical case where Rohit Sharma scores 290 runs facing 280 balls on a flat pitch in an ODI, and say the team score is 309. Would the team stand to gain or lose by this? Rohit will walk into the record books by being the highest score in ODI and blah blah, but has he served the team's purpose of helping it to a winning score? Imagine the impact of a quickfire 60 off 30 balls types in the last 15 overs. Will take Rohit's 80 off 70 balls up front than these Test match type innings. Wish he had the team's 350 as target, sadly it isn't.

Again lame excuses, IMO Rohit started to dash very late. Even KP in the com-box said "Rohit must shift to 6-mode in this over". When an opener piles on 170+ runs, the batting side should pile at least 350. And again after 100 he used too many balls. IF Virat would've gone passed 100, he'd move to 5th gear asap. IMO India lost because of Rohit's slow batting.

The next three months will decide the fate of Dhoni. He has been dodging media questions about when he'll retire. I don't think he's got a plan about his future with the team or the team's future with him. He should continue playing only if he is confident he'll be able to go on to play the 2019 WC. There's no point in continuing until 2017 or 2018 and then suddenly making the retirement call. India can not afford to find a replacement for him within one year (for the keeper position as well as the finisher's role). He is fit, but his form is the major concern. One thing is for sure - there can never be another player like him in ODIs.

@SAMROY not sure what you meant by talking up the chances. Aus team may be favorite, but it looks beatable.India has every chance of winning some games if not series. But one thing for sure India under Dhoni is usually silent before most series they play. WACA did give India an opportunity to get used to the conditions which will get slower as the tour progresses due to the itinerary.

One of the problems with Indian Management is that they never play down their chances. Now you hear Bharat Arun saying that "playing 2 practice matches at WACA gives us the advantage". What kind of advantage? Advantage of not losing as poorly as they would now. At least Bharat Arun could have said "It is good that our guys got a chance to practice at WACA but it is the WACA and the first match and vs Australia next and so Australia massive favorites to win that one". That way you reduce a little bit of pressure from Indian Team. With reduced expectations they could free themslves and play a little freely and compete better.

@USERNAMES Why was Gurkeerat promoted in this game and sent after 20overs? He is a big hitter after 40overs. Your captain doesn't even know that!  You are not an Indian fan if you are okay with Dhoni's failings. He should make no. 5 his permanent position even in T20s as his waning hitting powers are too obvious now. India will benefit from that.

This team has 5 proper bowlers.Pandey and Jadeja have to do the job of finishers.If Dhoni is there to finish the innings,then God save us.Pandey seems much better than Gurkeerat in batting.Ishant is much better bowler now.Kohli should not come at no.3.Rahane is in form and should come in at 3.

How can we let someone like you who couldn't  find a brand, and has to rely on a generic name, to launch into this commenting market,  down. No way. At least, I can't. So, I did my part of the duty, by having a word on my favourite Dhoni (now on decline). As you octo-pussed.
</p>
<p>
They say, it's  the drops that make an ocean, hope in this case- it least there will be enough to have a glass half-full. Please don''t take it as half empty. though.

The old debate about Delhi Vs Mumbai has ended in a draw. Delhi (Shikhar &amp; Kohli) doing well, yesterday; Mumbai (Rohit &amp; Rahane) doing so today.  Since none of the 4 is a spring chicken, India can face Oz bowling (especially without Stac) with some confidence. 
</p>
<p>
Lower middle is still in a muddle, though. All 3 of them!
</p>
<p>
Dhoni, the great finisher, looks a semi-spent force by now.  He seems to have misplaced his 'copter &amp; lost some spinach to popeye, since the power of his forearms has dipped like Mumbai stock market index - Sensex.  
</p>
<p>
Manish, after showing good grip on the bat handle, seems to have soothened his weary palms &amp; fingers with some butter, during the break . That showed up in his fielding;  an unpleasant surprise!
</p>
<p>
Don't know why Mann's feet decided to go on strike and stayed put on the pitch, so unlike his normal nimble  feet.
</p>
<p>
Any forecast on pacers? Not me!
</p>
<p>
Spin noose is still in good shape. Could tie a triple knot, also chipping in with runs, to hide the middle-muddle.

Same old story of Indians playing against a 3rd or may be 4th level team of Australia and winning in practice match. I am sure that the result of the international match would not be different from what they achieved last year.

Good batting by Iyer. He is by far the best young batsman in the country. Hope Rohit will convert his ton to a big one. Mumbai looks pretty strong this year.

release dhawan and replace him with karun nair .he is good batsmen n also a spinner.we can send either pujara or rahane as opening batsmen n we can play nair in the middle order. also replace saha with either Rahul or sanju or naman ojha.

Actually Bhuvaneshwar should have played in tests where he is best. But BCCI will keep on playing him in ODIs and T20s where he is not good at and use his performance there to conclude that he is not good for tests.

As long as they don't injure themselves, I guess playing Ranji is not a bad move. Players usually don't improve from Ranji, it's absolutely no where close to international level. 
As far as WK goes, there is no comparison to Saha. Saha's keeping skills are way beyond that of Rahul's. A good keeper is required to make those magical moments happen. I'm sure Saha will step up his batting in the second inning, as long as his position isn't switched again. The only replacement for Saha in terms of keeping is Naman Ojha.

Whether it's the new BCCI top brass or the new team management, whoever brought this change must be complimented. They are still selecting 16 players for a home series which is too many. At most 13 or 14 players should be in the squad for a home test. Yes they had to play Saha as a batsman once when Rohit got injured on the morning of test match but that was also due to poor squad selection. In a home series 13 or 14 players can cover all bases and provide enough cover for a freak injury / illness.

India needs players who're better players of spin if they're gonna produce rank turners. In the earlier years, we had Sourav, Laxman. Dravid &amp; Sachin weren't really bad either. But in order to get good players of spin, you need to have good spinners in the domestic circuit as well to get used to that. Unfortunately, IPL has killed the spinners completely. I would just wish the new upcoming don't get selected to the IPL teams or at least they're advised bowling in a T20 &amp; other formats is different. You can't keep bowling rockets like Axar Patel to get wickets. @Vimalan Ravindran: Gurukeerat must be first given chance in ODI's &amp; later tests unless any player is injured right before the test match.

@SERIOUS-AM-I Lastweek he hits 160 for Karnataka. DO you think Dhawan is a Test Material? What was Legend and his excellency Virender Sehwag?

I am not comparing Uthappa to them. But he is a keen player focused on test cricket rather ODI's or T20s. refer his interviews in cricinfo iteself. I believe Dhoni's concern over 5&amp;6in ODI's could be met with Kedar Jadhav&amp;Manish Pandey. Both did well when given chances.

Next would be to reach a consensus on DRS and to finally accept it. I hope Shashank Manohar's team would hopefully be receptive to it. Kohli is open to discussion on it.

@Vimalan Ravindran: While you're at it, why not have Vinay Kumar and the rest of the Karnataka team in there too?
In terms of the batting order, if you are going to have an out-of-form opener where Pujara (at no.3) comes in to bat in the 1st or 2nd over, might as well have Pujara open the innings with Vijay. He certainly has the technique and temperament for it. And, as Siddharth Monga has written in another article, Kohli needs to stop being stubborn about playing 5 bowlers come-what-may. In the 5-bowler plan, Saha is much too weak at no. 6. He's probably a no.7, at best.

When playing tests in India, we need only 1 pace bowler and 3 spinner. Rahul should be used as a wicket keeper. Saha is not consistent. Leave saha and give opportunity to rahul..My team Vijay, Rahul, pujara, kohli, Rahane, Rohit ,Mann ,jadeja, ashwin, mishra, ishanth...

I feel sometimes both kohli as useless. Better give India a new team, another downfall is awaiting for India in the form of test series. God only have to save Indian Cricket from this useless batsmans, selectors and Ravi Shasthri . Better arrange for a match India vs India A, which team   wins should represent India in all formats.

Finally, BCCI, thank you. This new leadership is doing some good work overall. The merits of this practice are being seen finally.
</p>
<p>
Have never understood the adamant leadership response to these issues, even if DRS is contentious there is no merit in avoiding these issues which help the team overall. The fielding excuse (similar to many other intelligent comments by Dhoni) doesn't make sense at all, there can be decent state level players who can substitute. (As in today's game, and as is practice in England and Australia).
</p>
<p>
Now, can we please get different sides for T20s as well and rotation policy in ODIs, or is it that too much to ask?

Have never understood the adamant leadership response to these issues, even if DRS is contentious there is no merit in avoiding these issues which help the team overall. The fielding excuse (similar to many other intelligent comments by Dhoni) doesn't make sense at all, there can be decent state level players who can substitute. (As in today's game, and as is practice in England and Australia).
</p>, <p>
Now, can we please get different sides for T20s as well and rotation policy in ODIs, or is it that too much to ask?

good move by Indian team management.Although IPL provides opportunity to uncapped Indian players to play with International players but fielding in a test match against top international team gives a proud feeling.
In our college days when we used to practice in SMS stadium .and many a times we got opportunity of fielding in double wicket tournaments where Ranji players participated,and best fielder was awarded rs 500.That was a great feeling.

Kohli is just trying to prove that he is better and different captain than MSD. So that is why he is playing 5 batsmen and 5 bowlers and 1 unproved wicket keeper

Dhawan seems to be struggling  at the moment and needs to be rested. Rahul looks more confident with the bat. It seems strange that Rohit Sharma doesn't get a game which is a bad decision. India need  to play 6 batsmen and 4 bowlers.Saha at 6 means batting looks very thin.

only murali vijay and virat kohli is looks complete batsman in this team, dhawan is very edgy outside off stump, chetewar pujara look awkward while playing thats coming in from out side off stump and rahane is very edgy against spinner. So apart from virat kohli murali vijay is only batsman who can play pace and spin well. Rohit sharma should have played because rohit is excellent against spinners  as rohit would easily come forward and hit over long on and long off and rohit could also play fast bowler really well. Virat made a mistake while selecting is top 5 batsman as far a i see india must persist with rohit sharma and KL Rahul instead of pujara and dhawan.

I think Mr Monga the author has made it more complex than it really is. I still believe a left handed Raina or Jadeja to be the ideal last 4-5 overs players and our famous top order should manage to score till 15th over. Rahane at the top builds his innings well and Dhawan should play his natural striking game at the top. Follow it by Rohit and Kohli at 3 and 4 to speed up scoring 8-10 per over. Bring in a fresh face like Sanju Samson or the experienced Uthappa/Saha/N.Ojha to replace Dhoni for No.5 who rotate as well as strike depending on the situation, followed by Raina and Jadeja (yes, I still feel Sir Jadeja should be in the mix for the T20s) to give boost at 6 and 7. If we have free striking Binny to follow at 8, that will be a perfect finishing for our innings. Raina, Jadeja &amp; Binny can easily bowl 8-10 overs (out of 12) and then Ashwin + two bowlers can bowl 10-12 overs. Rayudu someone does not fit in this equation anywhere.

T20 is not a game of average for example rahane generally scores 60 off 50 balls but if a batsman scores 30 off 12 balls is far better inning,opposite team will love batsman like rahane.rahane will always score runs because these are automatic runs given by opposite team through rahane they don't want100 runs off 50 balls so it is clear rahane will always scoreThis is international cricket and there are only 120 balls don't waste 50 ball for 60 runs because 1.1 run a ball inning can be played by last three batsman and even now a days bowlers are also great hitters. Rahane innings gives no pressure to opposite side bowlers but pressurize same side batsman only so in a t20 team there should be hitters and average hitters so I don't include batsman like rahane dhawan . my team is
Uthappa, rohit,kohli,yusufpathan, raina/sarfaraz, sanju Sampson, Deepak hooda,Stuart binny/ harbhajan(pitch condition),ashwin,Aron/shami,Yadav/bkumar

Umesh,,Axar,Pandya,Mishra seem a good outfit to try out from. Some may fail but others will do well. We must know that Maxwell came out from being quite unknown. So we have to believe that there could be a brutal champion lurking in the shadows. Nerveless players are needed not excitable flashes in the pan.

Dhoni is no longer the daring stroke player of his earlier years. Now is the time to blood Hooda, Gurkeerat and Iyer. The problem is that there is this doggedness to retain the same players. Rohit, and co have been OK but not as daring as say a Hooda or Iyer or Gurkeerat can be. I hope these three are brought in some format or the other and a decision taken on the combination for the WC.

How about this side (per batting order) - Kohli, Rahane, Raina, Rohit, Dhoni, Yuvraj / Suryakumar Yadav / Yusuf Pathan, Jadeja, Ashwin, MIshra, B Kumar / Nehra, Umesh Yadav / Shami (options cited to be chosen from based on form over the next 8-9 T20Is leading up to the WC)? If India's (and Dhoni the captain's) strength in playing with spinners, and since the WC is in India, why are we so (inexplicably) reluctant to pack our side with spinners? Especially since (a) they have a proven T20 record as a lot (vis-a-vis fast bowlers), (b) they are some of our best T20 bowlers (think: Ashwin &amp; Mishra in the IPL), and (c) they also happen to be our best all-rounders, both as a lot and individually (think: Jadeja, Ashwin, in fact even Raina, Yuvraj).

why there is too much talk about rayudu's inclusion over rahane......Rayudu is clearly the right choice as he is a middle/lower order batsma....he has done extremely well for MI last season...whereas Rahane is a top order batsman and not a clean striker of cricket ball.....only position he could suit in current team is an opener.....he can't bat @ 5,6 or7....This should be the ideal team  1-VOHRA/AGARWAL, 2-ROHIT                   3-KOHLI, 4-RAINA 5-DHONI, 6&amp;7-RAYUDU,PATHAN,KULDEEP YADAV                                8-BHAJI/MISHRA    9-ASH    10-KUMAR 11-SHAMI/NEHRA....kuldeep yadav is an excellent bowler &amp; is much like narine...he can be the mystery spinner......

Raina, Dhoni &amp; Jadeja did their bits in that role fairly well for some time. But they are all on the decline.

It's high time to try &amp; develop players like Pandya, Hooda, Gurkeerat and the like. Even though Shreyas is rather young and a player positions in the top 3 or 4 , he has the attitude to play the Maxwellian role down the line

<p>
The critical question is: How can these young ones develop, unless given adequate opportunities?

Expecting MSD to do what he did in his early years as an int'l player wud be futile now. Every player is an unknown entity when dey spring onto d scene. Bowlers constantly try to work batsmen out &amp; vice versa. He's been found out by most bowlers &amp; his theory of waiting for d bowlers to make mistakes when the pressure is equal on both him &amp; the bowler who wud then bowl full tosses/full length deliveries in d final few overs doesn't work anymore. Becoz bowlers have realised dey just don't need to attempt yorkers at all. Bowl short of good length widin d stumps &amp; he is clueless &amp; rigid/overconfident enuf to keep waiting for d bowler to make mistakes even till the last ball of d innings. Exactly what u saw in d 1st T20. He is no SRT/Dravid who wud play an ugly innings to get their form back. Any number of ugly innings won't help him as he doesn't have a reliable basic technique.

Expecting MSD to do what he did in his early years as an int'l player wud be futile now. Every player is an unknown entity when dey spring onto d scene. Bowlers constantly try to work batsmen out &amp; vice versa. He's been found out by most bowlers &amp; his theory of waiting for d bowlers to make mistakes when the pressure is equal on both him &amp; the bowler who wud then bowl full tosses/full length deliveries in d final few overs doesn't work anymore. Becoz bowlers have realised dey just don't need to attempt yorkers at all. Bowl short of good length widin d stumps &amp; he is clueless &amp; rigid/overconfident enuf to keep waiting for d bowler to make mistakes even till the last ball of d innings. Exactly what u saw in d 1st T20. He is no SRT/Dravid who wud play an ugly innings to get their form back. Any number of ugly innings won't help him as he doesn't have a reliable basic technique.

India's selection is left to be desired. Other than Suresh Raina, no other indian batsmen are capable of playing in a position of 5, 6, 7 &amp; 8. Rohit, Dhawan, Virat, Ajinkya &amp; Rayadu all are capable of playing big innings but in the top 4 positions and that is why India have been struggling in Odi's and T20's. If we we have Suresh Raina at number 5 then we do not need any other specialist batsmen at no 6. What we need is two seaming allrounders out of the 4 allrounders in domestic cricket. These 4 allrounders are Irfan Pathan, Stuart Binny, Rishi Dhawan and Hardik Pandya. They may not be great batsmen but are capable enough to provide 20 ball 30 runs down the order. We need have a spinning allrounder at no 8. It may be Gurkeerat Mann, Ravindra Jadeja or Deepak Hooda who ever is fit and in form.
</p>
<p>
So my team would be 1) Rohit 2) Dhawan/Ajinkya 3) Virat 4) Dhoni/Samson 5) Raina 6) Binny 7) Pandya 8) Gurkeerat/Jadeja 9) Ashwin 10) Bhuvi 11) Shami

Rohit, Kohli, Raina are great, In my opinion they are not as great as say ABD, Miller (on his day Duminy looks better than them). SA has QDK, Roussow, Puff... so only on batting they win. Amla plays the role Rohit or Kohli is playing and he is just more reliable. To me india has too much talent, has a tendancy to idolize their current players. Whats amazing about india, their #100 batsman is amazingly good. India's greatest disability is that indians think they should win all the matches, if they start to lose one or two they come with this weird reasoning (in their mind no one can beat them not even ABD, not Root not Smith or Williamson).

Agree with the article. My team: Mayank Aggarwal, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Shreyas Iyer/Gurkeerat, Sanju Samson, Pandya / Rishi, Ashwin, Kuldeep, Chahal, Nehra. (Play Bhuvi/Shami in place of either Kuldeep or Chahal if its a wicket assisting pacers). Other substitute: Deepak Hooda.

There are two problems, first bowling worries for India more than batting as they were unable to defend even 200 in T20 and 2ndly malicious comparison of IPLwith international cricket . There is a huge gap between the standards of IPL and international cricket.

We are in the same phase we were in in 2007, Sachin dravid &amp; Sourav opted to stay away from T20's similarly our seniors shd have opted out of T20 from 2014 keeping in mind the 2016 WC &amp; we could have groomed a young T20 team with Virat captaining the team. Test captaincy should have gone to R.Ashwin &amp; MSD should have continued as the ODI captain.

Rahane, Shreyas Iyer, Raina, Kohli, Rohit followed by Dhoni should be the top 6. India should learn from IPL. Learnings: 1) Suresh Raina is the best T20 player for India- You look at his IPL records and stats- far better than anyone- He should bat at no.3 where he has been so successful. 2) Shreyas Iyer and Rahane are the top two openers, so Shikar Dhawan is out. 3) Rohit Sharma and Dhoni can play No. 5 and No.6. The best Indian bowlers were: Yuz Chahal, Nehra followed by Ashwin. This leave just 2 places (bowlers) to be filled in.

Indian selection boggles the mind.  We have a domestic T20 league.  All over the world, the national team is comprised with the best performing T20 domestic league players.  Why can't India do the same?  Pick the best performing IPL players.  Is Rayudu or Bhuvi, Binny in the top 11 of IPL?  No - so why then are they in the national team?  Look at the top performers and then pick - you can do that in T20.  ODI's and Test are different matter.

India is making a hell of a problem from nowhere.
</p>
<p>
Team lineup: Rahane, Kohli, Raina, Rohit, Yuvraj, Dhoni, Jadeja, Ashwin, Mishra/Umesh, Bhuvi, Shami should seal the batting line up. Can keep either from Mishra/ Umesh depending upon spinner/seamer friendly pitches.  With 12 people already picked go for dhawan, mohit and axar but just for back.
</p>
<p>
Though its a 15 member squad but utilize rahane and kohli as openers instead of sticking to dhawan just b'coz he a left hander. Dhawan is highly inconsistent, 150-120 S.R player instead would go for sure-short Kohli and rahane which will give consistent starts (as both players doesn't like to throw away their wicket easily) and can increase their S.R in long innings. Raina at 3 will surely increase S.R as he can play freely their as one of the openers can play throughout from one end. Rohit who seems comfortable in t20 can play anchor role and he can shift gears anytime. Rest selection is considering to pick best from what's available!!

As long as India does not have one or two real fast boler who can bowl the death overs effectively they can not hope to be successful in T 20 Matches.Their spinners can not hold a good team like Soth Africa or Australia.

Players like dhawan, rahane, rayudu, Mishra, bhajji, mohit , binny should be kept away from indian t20 team as they are no longer game changers at international level. Selectors need to look beyond reputations and pick a team very different from odi's by including t20 specialists like:-
</p>
<p>
Yusuf
Hooda
Pandya
Mayank Agarwal
Manan vohra
Chahal
Negi
Kuldeep Yadav

Hmmm, no matter what analysis you do here or there, india team will still play like this and more humiliations are coming for the odi series. How about some math for you, bcci? If I get huge money by only playing few matches in the ipl, why would I feel the passion for cricket in national team? Or should I? More embarrassment waiting in the odis and then tests.

Since the world cup is in india, we should simply pick the best indian performers across all ipl teams. The XI should be like:-
</p>
<p>
1. Rohit
2.Kohli
3.Raina
4.Yusuf
5.Dhoni
6.Hooda
7.Pandya
8.Negi
9.Ashwin
10.Bhuvi
11.Shami
</p>
<p>
Power hitters like Yusuf, hooda and Pandya should be allowed to express themselves and play with an uncluttered mind.

Very well written article and finally addresses the issue that has been plaguing India for a while now in both T20Is and ODIs. India lacks a serious power hitter in the current lineup who has all the unorthodox shots to complement the textbook shots. All the other consistent performing teams have them (Warner &amp; Maxwell for Aus; AB &amp; Miller for SA, pretty much everyone in WI, Morgan Eng, McCullum, Ronchi &amp; Anderson for NZ). The current Indian batting stock is behind Sehwag and Yuvi in terms of power hitting let alone the current state of the art. They seem to get away with it on smaller Indian grounds, but their limitations were obvious in Aus in last WC where they struggled to score big runs and accelerate at the end.

dhoni has been scoring at a strike rate of 110-112 but he has never tried improving his game never heard dhoni winning any T20 match in blues still he has opinion about other players whom he does not like dhoni never commented on a poor performer ravindrajadeja he always backed his words with grooming talent and maturing him but not one criticism against him.

I cannot understand why the team management is so persistent with Ambati Raydu. He is an absolute waste considering other talented players we have around. Why not give that many chances to Ajinkya Rahane? He is a better player. Ambati has never performed well at a highest. He looks to be a timid player on a the pitch. Even when he tried to be aggressive the ball barely crosses the 30 yard circle.

The problem is lack of genuine all rounders you cannot ask your whole ODI side to run show in T20 as well they really need a blast ballon soecially for T20. Another big issue is bowling attack sorry to say i cannot see any spunk in bowling excluding Ashwin

@zombiehunter regarding yuvi ..what I meant to say was yuvi has been low on form lately and it is sad that it has not changed. I have no question about his past records as they are very good, but we all saw what happened in the worldt20. After his cancer, he has unfortunately lost some of his strenghts and it is taking time to recover. My issue is when people here blame just dhoni. Look at kohlis recent records as well? His best was in the last world t20. I will mention again that my issue is that people just blame dhoni, where as the issue is much more than him. Regarding dhoni coming in the slog overs only, who else do we have who has the ability to hit the ball hard? when he comes up the order...people say he wants to take away yuvraj's or kohlis credit and gain name.  And mate at least csk was consistent which none of the teams except mumbai have managed.

T20 and ODI is all about Momentum. India always had a pair who score briskly putting the opponents at the back foot right at the start. The big problem at hand is Rohit. He takes time to get off the blocks and more than compensates when he gets going. But the problem is batsmen at the other end: they are denied strike and invariably get out due to release shot or trying to steal a single. There is always a pattern in Rohits partners dismissal and its no coincidence. Once Dhawan and Kohli gets our under 50..its an implosion from there.

Because most of the batsmen play Twenty20 and 50 overs similarly, the approach towards run scoring is also similar. Abraham DeVilliers plays differently in Twenty20 and 50 overs, he is an example of adaptive cricketer, whom every cricketer should follow. An important thing overlooked in this Twenty20 series was, that, India never chased a total and Indian cricketers are always more comfortable chasing total.

Indian T20 needs different line up.   Mayank Agarwal, Rahane, Virat, Rohit (Captain), Suresh Raina, Sanju Samson, Ashwin, Deepak Hooda, , Bhuvanesh, Amit Mishra, Umesh/Shami-- reserve  Umesh or Shami, Chahal(Spinner), Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey.        MSD is not in a very good form so he can take a rest for a short while. He can focus on batting to bring his form up.

@Crickology: You should better check your facts before digging comments on greats like Yuvi n Kohli. Agreed as a Captain, nm..but as a player Yuvi was the powerhouse on which both our Wc wins were based..not just coming in the end to score the winning runs..Yuvi was the Man of the tournament.. Kohli has been the only stable player on all platforms..has the highest number of centuries after great Sachin..As a player.. Dhoni only adds dots..comes to play when limited balls are left so no blame..if he misses.. how many times has he promoted himself to lead the charge. Yes, right. So, don't bring your IPL bullshit here..we all know.. what happened since last two seasons.. all u cud do is just reach the final n give us a bad match..now u don't have a team..I can go on

The analysis is partially correct. . For the top, choices have to be made &amp; my vote would be for Kohli, Dhawan, Raina, Rohit &amp; Dhoni to make the top order. Surya Kumar Yadav got a lot of runs as a finisher for KKR. Ashwin, Harbhajan &amp; Sami take 3 more places. The other 2 need to be chosen from amongst Gurkerat, Binny,Ashish Reddy, Bhuvi, Mohit,Irfan,Axar etc.

SA - 2. Rain - 1. India - 0. 
If Zaheer is match fit, I think he should be tried one last time along with Nehra for the ODI. For batting, I think Gambhir should get a chance along with Yusuf for one last time. I think the experience will help.

Very Sad to see India loosing a T20 series despite having such a grand tournament of T20 every year we all know as IPL. What is the point of having such a tournament when you end up choosing only those regular players for all the three formats with couple of changes here and there. Why can't selectors think out of the box and choose choose the best players from the IPL games for all the T20I India has to play. that way young players will get International exposure and over the time they will be ready for the big occasions whenever get a game.

Why can't selectors think out of the box and choose choose the best players from the IPL games for all the T20I India has to play. that way young players will get International exposure and over the time they will be ready for the big occasions whenever get a game.

<p>
In ODIs and T20 : 1.Dhawan,2.Rohit,3.Virat,4.Rahane,5.Ravindra Jadeja,6.Dhoni,7.Raina,8.Ashwin,9.Yadav,10.Shami,11.Bhuvi. Reserves being Rayudu,Ashish Nehra,Mishra,Pujara(outside subcontinent).

Ravindra Jadeja should be picked in Indian team and should bat at 5.He has performed decently in current Ranji matches with both bat and ball. Amo g Axar,Binny,Yousuf,rasool,gurkeerat only Jaddu is the player who can bowl his complete 10 overs regularly along with adding 40-50 runs while batting at Number 5.And there is no point to compare his fielding with anyone.

T20 team should have only three to five 50 over / test players. Not a fan of Rohit, but he seems to be the best batsman. Time to bring in at least two of Hooda, Mayank and Gurkeerat Mann. Also, change captaincy - pick Rohit or Dhawan - and play Samson as keeper. MSD can be specialist batsman, till the world cup.

dhoni has been scoring at a strike rate of 110-112 but he has never tried improving his game never heard dhoni winning any T20 match in blues still he has opinion about other players whom he does not like dhoni never commented on a poor performer ravindrajadeja he always backed his words with grooming talent and maturing him but not one criticism against him.

I increasingly get the feeling that great Mr. MSD is on his way out. Yes, his dwindling batting riches is only one of our concerns. It is his inflexible, calcified thinking at the top that is more worry some.

I think yuvi should be brought in. Opening rohit &amp; rahane. Roh hit shots &amp; rah stroking boundaries til 6th over. 3Rd batsman kohli should play shots(safer) and steady the score till 10th over even if roh outs (as big hitting). Raina 4th play big shots til 15th over if he fail yuvi can do that but both somehow must play till 15th over. Score could reach easily 120 to 140 in 15th. Then dhoni can manage remaining 5 overs with ashwin/bhuvi/chawla. Chawla could be picked instead of  axar for leg spin(he can bat well too(ipl he did)). Pace bowling yadav, shami, bhuvi could be better. Just a thought.

In T20, play no one older than 30. Get Mandeep Agarwal, Manan Vohra, and such others and ditch the seniors. Consider it as a kid's fun format.

No problem with Rohit in opening, he has done well in ODI and T20. Kohli can open like Sachin did. Send your best to face the most overs and score big. MSD should bat up the order with Raina. Get Rahane in the team, he is a fine batsman and fielder. India will always suffer when bowling is concerned. Get your best four bowlers, hate to name any except Ashwin who can bat. Get a young wicketkeeper in before MSD quits.

with such huge money they get, now they are least bothered to die out for country where it mattes most.... individually good performers, failure as team... so whats the mantra to keep them united ?.  change the captain and remind other self proclaimed stars that they are not indispensable.  Raina/Jadeja and Dhawan deserve no mare place in T20.  enough seen and heard about  them just because Dhoni like them.  I am seeing lot of statements from Manjrekar, Shastri and others, change this, we work on flexible plans, B Kumar should swing more, cut pace, repeatedly selecting a goner like Ishant, persistence with Ashwin in death overs and lot of such stuff is all contributing to demise of this unit.... need to go out and try to win, no other philosophy/formula/equation works better than feeling pride for playing country, and this is absent due ridiculously easy earned huge amounts in IPL. cut down on IPL matches as well and make it bi-annual affair, IPL is damaging bowlers.

Agreed with Monga... This is my team. 
1. Rahane 2. Uthappa 3. Kohli 4. Raina 5. MSD 6.Yusuf 7. Gurkeerat, 8. MIshra, 9. Ashwin 10. Shami 11. Umesh 12. Mohit 13. Vohra, 14. Manish Pandey 15. Ashish Nehra.
My theory is : One Explosive opener ( Uthappa), One Middle order ( Raina) , One finisher ( Yusuf), Clever spinners ( Ash and Mishy) and a reasonable bench strength. 
We cant have the Rayudu's Dhawan's, Binnys' and talents like Rohit Sharma destroy the team. There is a reason why IPL is being played and if you dont give them chance , how will you win the world cup. Jsut look at other nations like S Africa and Australia who have different teams for diff formats.
Just remember Sachin, Dravid ,Sourav , Zak did not play the 2007 T20 world cup and we went in with a young fearless team. We were the ones who made the game famous, cant we take fearless decisions for one time.

india should try big hitting all rounders like Deepak Huda, Yusuf Pathan, Gurkeerath, Pandya in the order for slots like No.6 and No.7.

India has Raina as a batting allrounder along with him, they may try above mentioned batting all rounders at No.6 and No.7 rather than bowling all rounders like Akshar, Jadeja..

Batsman : Dhoni(C&amp;Wk),Kohli,Rohit, Dhawan, Rahane,Kedar Jadhav
All Rounders : Raina, Gurkeerath, Deepak Hooda, Binny
Bowlers : Bhuvi, Ashwin, Mishra, Harbhajan, Nehra, Shami

I agree with Anirban. He made a very good point which is overlooked. Dhoni mounts the pressure on the batsmen at the other end by playing dot balls. So other batsmen come under the pressue and forced to take their chances. Even if dhoni makes up for the dot balls, the loss already done due to other batsmen getting out is irrepairable

Until India accept the DRS review system there is a perception that they do not want to play by the same rules as the rest of the cricketing world. This maybe construed as wanting to cheat. 
Lately several key decisions have gone against India changing the outcome of the game.
It is about time the management changed their stance.

As Sidhu noted, India dont have a powerful hitter at No.6 and No.7. Unfortunately, Dhoni has not been great in T20.He is Just OK.Many bowlers started to take the pace of the ball and to bowl wide yorkers against Dhoni.
Cant blame Dhoni for the selections in playing XI.Selectors must give chances to "POWER HITTERS" frm IPL teams before World T20.Hooda,Yusuf Pathan,Pandya.Yusuf Pathan should be seriously tried in one series and check if he can do well. Rahane can be made to open but crying over for 110-125 Strike batsmen like Rahanes and Samsons is futile.They are just capable of hitting the balls through the gap at most instants. We need players who is capable of changing the course of the match in one or two overs.India make huge scores only when top 4 makes runs.Most times,when India lose top 5 wkts,the hope of winning is shattered.Bt if we see Aus,SA,WI,NZ,Pak thr r players like Faulkner,Miller,Russell,Ronchi,Afridi@6&amp;7 who r capable of winning the match evn whn the top order fails.

India needs to come up a bowling plan.  One idea can be attacking left handed batsman with harbhajan singh for the likes of duminy and  Miller.  Need to make sure harbhajan has couple of overs left when these two are at the crease. Any other plans can we think of?

Despite hitting a century just days ago, people want Rohit to move down the order. And that is to accommodate an underperforming Rahane in the team. Doesn't matter how well Rohit plays, some people just don't like him.

well said@ ASHOKIES7. We all praise our players when they win and we criticise them when they lose. We have no patience to adjust this defeat. Nobody can deny it that our bowlers are not upto the mark. Ashwin is only wicket taking bowler in Indian squad and all the pacers are same quality and same approach. Umesh or Aaron should be there for variety. We should not criiticise our captain after one defeat. All the young players who r doing well at the domestic level they all have their own time to come into indian team. Our batsmen in current team all are very capable and I think India will win odi and tests. Plz have patience.

The most important player India is missing is Yuvraj Singh!!! He makes all the difference. He has showed the glimpses in this year IPL . There is no match to him and all he needs is some good practice. He is the one who has changed the momentum whenever he came into bat.  Just bring him back!!  He is by no way finished. IPL was a proof. He still can hit the big shots with ease and can take on any bowler. Remember him hitting 3 sixes of Saeed Ajmal!! 
</p>
<p>
I hope he is given a chance!! Not judged by just one match. He is leading six hitters in T20 world cup. I hope he finds more support from real cricket fans

haha one or two meaningless losses and everyone starts complaining on how bad dhoni is. What has kohli achieved as a captain yet? he hasn't won a single ipl ..just a test series against a weak sri lankan side. What has yuvraj done? bcci and dhoni gave him chance in the last world t20 based on his world cup records ..and we all saw what happened to the great yuvraj singh.

Nehra should get a spot in T20. He has done quite brilliantly for CSK in IPL. Problem for India is No.6 and No.7. India need a player like miller, pollard, maxwell at no.6. And an all rounder like russel, faulkner at no.7. Also there needs to be change in opening. Dhawan not in form and it is better to replace him with Rahane. And Rahane also contributes a lot in fielding compared to Dhawan. Rahane is a terrific fielder. He has proved his opening capabilities in IPL playing consistantly. Having said that major problem lies in no.6 and no.7. We need players who can produce just 2 huge overs to turn the tale of the game.

stupid excuse from dhoni really stupid come on dhoni even kids assess better than you if this bunch playing ipl since 2008 cannot play well in T20s then change the players why are you giving stupid excuses for losses. first of all you have never performed well in T20 change or leave you are blaming rahane. what have you done in T20.

India still has the nucleus to do very well. Dhoni is a bit too defensive in his captaincy. the issue which rocked us in tests is going to haunt us in T20 as well.  Dhoni the captain is dated.  Also, we need a solid No:6 who is a match winner.  While he is slower than before, Yuvraj could be the answer in Indian conditions instead of Rayudu.  Mayank Agarwal should be in the 14.  he could play instead of Shikhar Dhawan with Rahane opening alongside Rohit.  Gurukeerat or Stuart Binny can be the optional all rounder.  Dhoni purely as a batsman is still good.  He could slot in at 7 purely for a finishing role.  No pushing the ball around. If he cant, then better to play Ojha there or Dinesh Karthik.  Ashwin should be paired with Amit Mishra.  Bhuvaneshwar and Shami  are ideal among the fast bowlers with Sandeep Sharma as the 3rd option.

I guess the bigger problem is the no 7 and no 8 positions. Axar and Bhajji? Cant the selectors pick decent batting allrounders instead of bits and pieces players? The selectors need to be held accountable for the teams performance.

I am really surprised that Dhoni doesnt have a single 50 in international T20 even after playing regularly since 2007. I think he has lost his mojo as a captain and player in the shortest format and should seriously consider retirement. His stubbornness in leaving out a few players is really hurting India. Also, I feel India should have a powerful hitter at no. 6 &amp; 7 which will make a big difference.

Everyone talking about the aspect of changing the playing XI after one defeat. If india 's new players listed below not fulfill their chances, then everyone talks about seniors. Yuvraj is the great example. i read same kind of article which against Yuvi.. Now everyone (ofcourse same guys) talks abt yuvi to take him in the team.  Winning &amp; loosing are part of the game. one day our team win, we praise. Next day it lose, we scold. Our mentality is like that, we wont change forever. Unfortunately india is loosing, For me current team is so good (either dhawan or rahane opening). winning or loosing, india is india, our india. Support guys. i feel a bit, if india lose. But i will see the next match supporting india in every ball, even its a dead  rubber match.
I am not the supporter of any, but just i felt. why dont we keep three different captains in three formats to reduce the pressure of captains? T20s-Rohit, ODIs-Dhoni &amp; Tests-Kohli. I think its good. common guys enjoy to watch cricket

I refuse to go with Sid Mongas assessment. Rohit, Dhawan, Kohli, Rahane and Raina place themselves in this order. These are class players and can adapt to the situation. Rahane and his ability to only strike new or fast balls is a myth created by may I allowed to say MSD. Rahane is undoubtedly one of the best batsmen  in India in all 3 formats of the game. It is failure of MSD to score quick runs in the slog overs, his unwillingness to let Raina bat down the order to score quick runs that is hurting India. MSD is doing great disservice to India by excluding Rahane and Mishra from home T20s and ODIs for the likes of Rayudu and Patel. I may be wrong but Rahane's exclusion could be a ploy to allow MSD to bat at no 4 in ODIs and Mishras exclusion could be due to MSD's stubbornness to replace dropped Jadeja with the same like for like replacement of Axar Patel. Either way it is hurting India. We have lost against Bangladesh in ODIs and not in T20 to SAF.

It's really a strange comment from Dhoni on the strength of his players and their approach to T20 and 50-overs cricket. If T20 is not their strength, why can't MS get specialists in T20 format? What India now lacks is a game-changer in the middle order in T20 format, and can be strengthened with the inclusion of Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan etc. These guys also have the capability to adapt themselves to different kind of surfaces and play accordingly. Or, India can consider including Mayank Agarwal and Unmkut Chand as T20 openers as India more often than not tend to waste first six overs unless it's an excellent batting surface. Either strengthen the middle order or go for aggressive openers as that's the only way for India to improve their batting performance in T20s. 
Moreover, if Dhoni wants to continue in T20s, he has to bat at 4 and take control of the innings as he can influence his thoughts on his partner. He's the best guide a partner can get at the crease

Why not play Raina, Kohli &amp; Rohith @ 3, 4 &amp; 5 or Kohli to open, Raina @ 3, Dhoni/Rohith @ 4/5.
My Ideal Team for World T20: Openers - 1 of Dhavan/Rahane/Kohli &amp; 1 of Vohra/Agarwal/Iyer - 1 to steady the innings &amp; 1 to attack. 6/7 - Pandya/Jadeja/Hooda/Sarfraz Khan/Yousuf Pathan. 8/9 - Ashwin/Bajji/Binny/Axar/Rishi Dhavan/Irfan Pathan. 10/11 - Bhuvi/Umesh/Aron/Mohith/Ishanth. I think this team will have the mixture of youth &amp; experience right from the top &amp; also spinning &amp; seaming all rounders. Since most of these youngsters have performed in IPL &amp; WT20 happens, it wouldn't be a challenge for them to perform.

India needs to be flexible and have different teams for the different formats. Not the same players in all formats but a young fearless team for T20, another for odi and one for tests. All players should be picked on current form and not past glories regardless who they are.

India is lacking strong destructive impact batsmens. The current lot of players are only good for test matches where they can take their time. Not one of the current lot of batsmen has the ability to take the game away from the opposition in T20 or odis. If you disagree, then name me one of the current lot who can win a game for India single handedly. Sadly MSD has lost this ability too. Tipping SA to whitewash IND on this tour.

Dhoni is the biggest culprit. From 2008 these people are playing T20 and still don't know how to be flexible in this format. He talks of the players strength but it is only 120 balls to bat and everyone needs to fire from the go. High time Dhoni retire from cricket

I think instead of bringing in someone new they could just let Rahane open with shikhar dhawan and let Rohit bat at no.6 in place of Rayudu. Rohit can be that big six hitter and improviser that they are looking for while rahane can bat his conventionally aggressive style like he plays for Rajasthan Royals.

With the same batting line up and same batting positions, India would have looked much better chasing. With not so good bowling attack and dew, defending is a big challenge for India. They need to plan and implement defending a total.

@FORMERMINER, If India's bowling is so toothless, how come they bowled out all opponents in 1 but every match of last world cup played in Australia? India always performs well in ICC tournaments, much better than South Africa. Even in last T20 world cup India were finalists. They lost only in finals. Don't forget about champions trophy. (in fact in all these 3 tournamets india lost only 3 matches in total). Just 2 matches India has lost  and you are blowing your  trumpet. This is not India's world cup 11 that is playing. Also World cup will be held in MARCH, so not much of dew. Spinners will come into action. I think South Africa is gaining false confidence by winning these non consequential games.

Indian Batsmen:
</p>
<p>
The difference between they doing well in IPL and not so for India is rather obvious . The top do well &amp; freely, only when they have big hitters in the middle, particularly the lower middle (like Maxwell, Miller, Pollard, Bravo and the like). That IS the case in IPL, not for India. Yuvi &amp; Raina used to do it. The former faded out. Latter is only 50% of his old self. The biggest loss is the form (?)of Dhoni.
</p>
<p>
We have raw material to work with: Hooda, Pandya, Gurkeerat et al. But the 'permanent squatters  do not vacate to let the new tenants to move in. 
</p>
<p>
Bowlers:
</p>
<p>
We just don't have any genuine wicket taking fast bowlers who can deliver on any pitch.  When it comes to spin, Ashwin is the only wicket taker. Many young ones are coming up.  But selectors keep on inviting some old &amp; not so effective tenants to come in and occupy those slots.

But I think the issue lies within the Indian Bowling line up. I agree that there is always a space for improvement and that's what this article state.

I think we need to invest in our Bowling. I remember that there was a time we had a big bunch of quality spinners in team and there was a competition 
</p>
<p>
among them to play in final 11 ( atleast in Subcontinent). From last few years we have lost that as well.  Bhajji disappointed me the most and I am pretty 
</p>
<p>
please to see the progress of Ashwin. I think we should have given Yadav and Aaron a  go. I know they have not done in recent past but still at least they 
</p>
<p>
have raw pace and can threaten opposition from that.

For long India have tried the same people in the T20 and ODI formats. I completely agree with the author when he says that most of them are essentially very similar players. We need a game-breaker or two in there instead of a couple of specialists. Maybe a Deepak Hooda or a Hardik Pandya. Maybe a Mayank Agarwal or a Suryakumar Yadav batting at the top. Maybe even an unconventional spinner like Kuldeep Yadav with the ball. Or we can try out veterans like Yusuf Pathan, Yuvraj Singh or even Irfan Pathan (if fit). There is indeed no harm in trying out a couple of things before the World T20.

Why people crying for y.singh . He has already past his best . We have already seen y.singh form in  ipl8 . There are far better option available . I do not know on wht basis the selection committee is selecting our team . S. binny struggling to be part of r.royal is selected for India team . A.rayudu batting at 6 make no sense  to me . WHy cant they realized s.dhawan  is not perfect for t20 . His strike rate is around 115 which is not acceptable in t20 .WHy cant they give chance to s.iyer or m.agarwal who can bat aggressively in powerplay overs.S.yadav or y,pathan can play the role of finisher .Both can hit the ball from ball one . S.yadav  is perfect batsman for t20 . Our bowling look pathetic expect R.ashwin . Bhuvi m.sharma and arvind all three only try to bowl slow delivery  .Neither of three can swing the bowl nor they have pace . A.nehra has performed so well in IPl always taking wicket in upfront . Why cant they select him for t20 . I think age should not be factor .

Been thinking the same actually. Need to reshuffle the T20 batting order, otherwise we are getting nowhere.
Rahane, Kohli, Raina, Rohit, Dhoni, Manish, Axar, Ashwin, Bhuvnesh, Vinay/Umesh, Mohit.
</p>
<p>
That can be one order.

<p>
Or,
</p>
<p>
Uthappa, Kohli, Raina, Rohit, Manish, Dhoni, Axar, Ashwin, Vinay/Bhuvnesh, Mohit.

The matter of fact is, we need to have Raina batting at 3 in T20s. He has been unbelievable consistent to not let him play there.

I feel that India needs to have 3 different coaches and 3 different captains for all three different formats by default.  Only in special circumstances should the same person be allowed to hold position across the formats.  Captain/Coach for each format should be responsible for success of their format.  I do feel that the test gets shortchanged in India because no one thinks about that format for too long.  Similarly now T20 is getting shortchanged because we are only thinking about IPL and not the national teams.

Apart from top order struggles, at lower middle order when Rayudu bats at 6 along with Dhoni, captain cool has very little or no faith in him...We saw that in T20 against Eng and in 1st T20 against SA...Dhoni himself thinks that Rayudu won't be able to finish off the innings properly then why to pick him? With such

I think we have fallen into the same trap that we were in with the last generation of players. Rahul Dravid, irrespective of being the most prolific, most consistent player, was sort of left in the shadows - never in the limelight, which was reserved for a few others. I think we are doing the same thing to another fantastic player like Rahane. If Rahane is a permanent fixture in the team, all three formats of it, it will strengthen the team's batting and fielding departments considerably. Hope the selection committee realizes their mistake here and keeps him in the playing 11 well before the T20 world cup.

One more thing to say - I m feeling very bored of seeing these players (rahane, rohit, shikar) in all three formats, The in-consistency of these players costing lots of games for India. Many times I have compared the Rohits talent with S.Marsh (AUS), they both look like have equal talent but they are never consistent. But the problem is selectors letting Rohit to play each every game, with out giving anybody else to chance to prove their talent. AUS is not making that mistake, they are respecting S.Marsh talent at the same time demanding consistent performances to get the next game or series and trying different people in his place. I think india should do the same, Rahane, Dhawan and Rohit have talent but india should keep trying other players on rotation basis.

My only question to the selectors is 'Is it mandatory to keep right hand , left hand combination at the top, even if they are performing?' India still have time to experiment for T20, they can try M.Agarwal, Kholi combination at the top. And also Dhoni as a senior member should take more responsibility by coming up in the order rather playing pinch hitter role.

Well i believe we could have past 200 in first t20. Thanks to Msd for not letting do so and the players in t20 should be reshuffled. We have a very predicted line up, we need to bring on young attacking players for this format and dhoni needs to give a rethink on his approach towards t20 else i totally agree that his posistion in the team is questionable.

Our selectors are a real confused lot. They pick up ODI/Test sides based on IPL performances(Ishwar Pandey,Karan Sharma,etc) and T20 sides based on God knows what comes in their dreams. If players like Mayank Agarwal, Manish Pandey, S.Iyer,Sanju Samson don't get picked in T20s then what is the use of their performances in IPL? Face it... The Shikar Dhawans and Ambati Rayudus are not T20I standard. If these mistakes are not rectified soon the World T20 is gonna come and go and we would just be limited to "gracious hosts" status,

India's problems in limited overs, when the pitches do not have much life in them, is that our bowlers are not good enough to outdo the conditions. And in the batting lineup, the likes of Rayudu do not really fit in. 
Dhawan, Sharma, Kohli, Dhoni, Raina, Gurkirat, Jadeja/Binny depending on conditions, Ashwin, Mishra, Bhuvneshwar, Yadav....... Dhoni needs to bat up the order and Raina needs to go down. A batsman who can attack rightaway, someone like a Gurkirat or Jadhav needs to come in at 6, Rayudu isn't the kind of batsman we need in that position. Perhaps in a year or 2, someone like a Hartik Pandya or a Deepak Hooda would be ready. Or else they'll have to go back to Yusaf Pathan.

SK12, I respectfully disagree. We could have scored 250 and I doubt the Indian team could have defended. The bowling is toothless in India. It is toothless in Test Matches, it is toothless in ODIs (expect ridiculously high scores like Ind-Aus 2013 series for the forthcoming one against SA), it is toothless in T20s. It does display claws in some overseas grounds. England 2014 and WC 2015 are examples where India bowled out the opposition in all matches. However, when the batting occasionally fails like the last game, the bowling offers no plan B. My harsh view is, it does not have plan A to begin with. This writer's analysis is knee-jerk Monday morning Quarterbacking!

The batting was much stronger when Yuvraj was batting at #4. Many a times it was he who provided the impetus to scoring after steady starts.

In my last post i try to put the problem India team facing in t20 . MY playing X1 for next series will be :
1. M.Agarwal/S. Iyer 2. V.kohli  3 . S.Raina  4. R.Sharma  5. M.S.Dhoni  6.Y.Pathan  7 . D.Hooda  8. R.Ashwin  9. Y.chahal /K.yadav  10 .A.nehra/Z.khan 11. U.Yadav/Shami.
I have tried to play the respective player at same position they play for their franchise in IPl  so they know their roles properly . M.agarwal S.iyer can play aggressively in powerplay overs .V.kohli will be the backbone of our batting department . Top 5 quality batsman . Y.pathan and d.hooda are perfect finisher . Four wicket taking bowlers . One experience fast bowler and other who can bowl with pace .Wht u guys think abt the team ? I think this team is perfect for subcontinent . We have enough resources . Our selectors  should select the team considering format and condition .

For me it appears that Present Indian T20 team will not be perfect T20 Team. T20 is completely different kind of crciket and here the major contributor for the runs is bit hitting with Avg. technique than 100% technique.
But sometimes there is a chnace that pitch will be completely bowling pitch.. For that we need some supporting batsman who can go for big hitting after getting settled. So, Depending on the pitch, T20 team shd be selected.
Every ball counts in T20.. So no point in settling when the pitch is completely a batting/ medium pitch. So, We need bit hitters from Ball 1 and some X factor like in other team(Eg: Warner, Maxwell in Aus; McCullum in NZ;Devilliers,Duminy,Faf in SA;
</p>
<p>
No place for mediocre bowlers like Mohit etc.. Except in 1 IPL he is not that successful in T20's... See the Bhuvi stats... successful in many T20
(I'm including IPL's)
</p>
<p>
So My Team India for T20's is:
</p>
<p>
M.agarwal,Kohli,Raina,Shreyas Iyer,R.Sharma,Dhoni,R.Dhawan,R.Ashwin,A.Mishra,Bhuvi,Shami,

The perfect article addressing issues with India's T20 line up. Clearly Rohit, Raina and Virat can't provide the finish to an innings that Yuvi of 2007 WCT20 provided. India need to get young talent from IPL who bat lower down the order and provide the explosive finish. Likes of Sarfaraz Khan, Surya Kumar Yadav and even Yusuf Pathan can provide that final flurry of runs. A 10 ball 25 run inning is what the team needs at the end. Even the all rounders that we have are not someone who can do that job. Ashwin, Axar, Bhuvi have taken place of Irfan and Bhajji who were capable of the task. Dhoni's place in T20's needs to be address as well.He is but a mere shade of his attacking ability when he first arrived at the international scene. I do not doubt his ability but the time he takes to bring out that innings is going to be too late for the team to deliver that final blow in a 20 over game.

I have a lot of respect for MSD. I feel he should retire from the T20I format as he's bringing the team down. Give virat a couple series as skipper in this format and I guarantee he'll get us into the finals at least at the WT20. Best Indian XI for T20 at the moment is Utthappa(wk). Rohit, Kohli(c), Raina, Rayudu,Binny, Bhajji, Ashwin, Mishra, Bhuvi, Yadav. Binny can chip in with an over or two. Ashwin can be the strike bowler, mishra attacking legspinner. Then you have the raw pace of yadav, control and swing of bhuvi, experience and batting of bhajji. The team works so much better if MSD steps down

@MITEAM11 Agreed with the point. In my opinion  i have pointed out some of the weakness India facing in T20 :
1. India has barely played T20 at international level so each player do not know exact role in the team . 
2.India lack match finisher who can bat at 6  . We need a batsman at no 6 who can bat aggressively and can play the role of finisher . right now a.rayudu is playing at 6  . By no means he is a match finisher .
3.T20 format do not require a genuine allrounder at 7 even a bit piece of cricketer like h.pandya binny p.negi can be match winner.
4. India lack quality bowler . Only match winner in bowling department is R.ashwin . A.mishra y.chahal and k.yadav in spin department should be given chance .
5. India lack genuine fast bowler in t20  who can take wicket in upfront . I do not think m.sharma arvind and other mid 130 pace bowler try to take wicket upfront .They just want to bowl economically . In my opinion A.Nehra / z.khan are temporary option . continue .....

It should be kept in mind that Hooda shined in only few IPL matches and not a great spinner either. Samson is a bad keeper. Uttappa, Mayank Agarwal and Manish Pandey needs to be more consistent. Suryakumar Yadav needs to be disciplined. Yusuf Pathan lost touch and good for Ranji matches only. Chahal just an IPL level bowler. Irfan Pathan  is not even playing for his domestic team. Vohra should establish in local level before being considered for international level. rishi dawan will be another Binny.Gurkeerat Singh is just a part time bowler. Jadeja just a Ranji wonder.Pandya should more Ranji matches.
At the end we are left with current team only!!

The 11 should be Kohli, Dhawan, Rahane, Rohit, Raina,  Dhoni,  Binny, Ashwin, Mishra, Bhuvi, Mohit. In fact remove these people to give the Samsons, the Aparajiths and the Aggarwals a chance to play for India early in their careers.. Can't believe Dhoni would drop Mishra for all those games.. He is the best limited overs bowler India have.. Ashwin included..

We need to give the Indian team a break. They've been constantly doing well on home pitches and just 1 slipped series causes panic. Give them a break, let them play their games. I know they will come back all bells and whistles in ODIs and Tests and it will not be this easy to beat them. Hope they can make Proteas taste a "L" in the last Twenty-20 because they will have to get used to it as the tour progresses.

The biggest mistake that Dhoni keeps on doing is giving chance to non-consistent players apart from himself(not all the times and in all formats) and backing them up - Now Rayudu Then Jadeja .  What sin, has poor Rahane has committed .

T20Is are young guys game. There are too many guys above 25 playing in the team. Retain 3-4 and fill the rest with guys below 25. Guys like Hooda, Samson, Gurkeerat, Iyer should be given chance. Let someone like Kohli lead them with aggression and you will get tough player on the road to represent country in ODIs.

I am requesting Dhoni to Stay out of T20 as he does like in Tests not just because of his current performance, we want the young kids to trigger. I think best choice is Samson to replace Dhoni. My team for T20 is Agarwal, Rohit, Vohra, Samson, Raina, Gurkeerat singh, R dhawan, R Jadeja, R Ashwin and Ishwar pandey. We want Dhoni, Shikar Dhawan should be out of the T20

I think Indian team has too many No. 3 T20 specialist in current line-up eg Raina for Csk Kohli for RCB and Rohit for MI. As India barely plays T20s at international level , these players yet to get set on their respective positions in international line-up.
So my suggestion is the players should be played at the position , where they are playing for so long for their franchise and the position where they are comfortable to play T20 cricket
Because there is lot of difference betweeen ODI cricket and T20 cricket and batting order should be according to players' ability to perform on bigger stage.
Line-ups in different formats can be different........

And yet this same lineup somehow fluked their way to 199? Talk about a knee-jerk reaction to what happened in the second game. Sometimes the cricketing gods just don't smile on a team and all their munificence goes to the opponent. We are awash in a plethora of stats and "coulda/shoulda/woulda beens" nowadays and people seem to just disregard the human element. Newsflash folks, sometimes players just have a bad day. If it happens collectively then blowouts happen. From all the comments I read the best squad for India is comprised of about 24 blokes who should all be in the lineup in one of 17 combinations. I have stated before that I have no idea what the real story is as it relates to the politics of selection in India (nor even NZ anymore). But if anybody is saying that the XI that go out there to play for their country isn't representative of the plurality of opinion from guys who have forgotten more cricket than I will ever know, then getting rolled for 90-odd is a secondary issue.

I don't understand why do we have to stick to the same team for t20 and ODIs.
If you know that you have under performing batsman at no. 5,6 and 7 try out some other player out of 100 odd players playing in the IPL! We have such good young talent in the IPL and still you stick to the players who under perform even in the IPL. High time to put Rayudu, Dhoni and Dhawan under scanner. Try out someone like Suryakumar, Gurkeerat, Hooda or Yusuf Pathan who would also offer something with the ball.
I guess at the top, we must also look for Gambhir, Uthappa or Vohra maybe.

Ideal team for T20 world cup will be:  Rahane, Rohit, Kohli (Captain), Raina, Robin, Yusuf, ashwin, bhuvi, mishra, Chahal, Nehra. 
I sometimes feel surprised Chahal is not selected in T20 after consistently performing well for RCB. 
Only this bowling unit can restrict any team within 140-160 score which our batsman can make easily. 3 spinners just for the reason world cup is going to be played in India

Our biggest problem is playing same team and also politics behind the leadership/power of the team downplay big role. We must make clear on leadership and have different leader/team in all the format. Captain and V Captain of the format should be as follows T20I : MS Dhoni/Raina,  ODI :  Kohli/R Sharma, Test: Pujara/Ashwini. With this leadership a lot of problem will be solved automatically.

Main problem is that it's a same team playing all the format. It's not easy to switch gears as you get in the field. Likes od R Sharma, Dhawan and Kohli are playing all the formats. A lot of fans advocate Rahane playing all the formats as well. We must find who is best at the particular format and gets enough rest to perform at their best. My T20I XI would be (1) V Kohi (2) Mayank Agarwal (3) S Raina (4) M S Dhoni (5) R Sharma (6) RA Jadeja (7) Suryakumar Yadav (8) S Binny (9) R Ashwin (10) B Kumar (11) A Nehra. I bet this team will perform lot better than what we have.

@FORMERMINER - with the start we got in the 1st match we shld have got atleast 220. That could have got us the game (or maybe not, but thats a diff problem). The author has rightly explored the recent weakling in our batting - the slog over hitting.

It's true. India need to shuffle their batting order when it comes to T-20.
Raina has been doing great job for CSK in IPL. I think the reason Dhoni preferred him down the order in 50 overs match is due to his Finishing ability.
But we have to understand that in 50 overs, finishers often comes to crease at 35-40 + overs. And in T-20, game starts from there itself if we compare 50 -50 and 20-20.
We are really wasting Raina's T-20 talent by sticking to 50 over batting order.
I think since India is unable to find opening partner for Rohit in T-20, Raina is the guy for it who can best utilize power play.
For me, my best playing 11 in T-20 with batting order would be :
R sharma, S Raina, V Kohli, M Pandey, M Dhoni, Y pathan, H Pandya/Gurkeerat mann/ A patel/ S binny, R ashwin, B kumar, A nehra, M shami/P kumar 
</p>
<p>
In T-20, You need power hitters who can win you matches single handed. Hence included likes of Pathan, Pandya etc. and Manish pandey to have stability in middle order.

Sir , at times Even a score of 200 is Not Enough . We have Seen 200 being Chased down With Ease many times in the IPL . My Point is that India Don`t Have a 200 Strikerate Batsman , One Who Can Clear The Rope from ball One . Axar Patel is Not a No 7 Batsman , Raydu is Worthless at No 6 , Ashwin is a Classy Batsman but in Test Cricket only , Dhoni`s Power hitting has Deserted Him . That`s Why India Need a Yusuf Pathan or Even a Yuvraj at No 7 Who Can Destroy Bowling Attacks Like - 
Russel from WI
Miller from SA
Corey Anderson from NZ
Butler from England

There are no dreath of big hitters, but there is lack of confidence in their ability. I still want to see jadeja in T20, he may not be big six hitter but can be very busy and his fielding is more than handy. In the recent days Gurkeerat has emerged as exciting but have to wait and see if he can replicate it at big stage. There is Kedar jahav, but he is no Rohit sharma and doesn't oooze style! Sanju is for future therefore leave him aside. Binny is show pony at international level. Manish Pandey can hit but does not fit in MSD's books. Mandeeps and Mayanks will be mostly A team players for rest of life. MSD has to play No.4 and if we can find another opener, id like Rohit at No.5 or 6 but then who will open the innings?

Mr. Monga, instead of playing the same guys in different batting order why not look outside? Gurkeerat is the best all rounder for the short format. Why is he OUT? Uthappa, Agarwal, Iyer are also good attacking openers. Pandey, Hooda, Sarfraz &amp; Samson are attacking bats. With so much talent available we play with the same Guys who are inconsistent. Honestly can Rayudu match these talented youngsters by retaining his spot despite his Golden Ducks? Rohit irresponsibly gets Kohli &amp; himself run out &amp; gives SA 2 Free Gifts! Youngsters of India A beat SA easily while India lost twice! This begs for a change in Team India.

Enough of left-right combo. Just play your best  batsmen. Rahane-Rohit, Kohli, Raina, Dhoni, Yusuf Pathan, Ashwin, Bhuvi,Axar, 2 pacers - in that order. Rohit and Kohli should aim to stay long and they can still hit boundaries. Rest everyone should only look to score at 130+ strike rate. What does S Dhawan do? He hardly scores rapidly, is not a very agile fielder. However, nothing will change because our captain is no longer flexible, smart captain that he used to be. Now, he also has an additional pressure of keeping his captaincy in T20 &amp; 50 overs.

Not a word on bowlers or All rounder, they play important role in T20 as well. From current bowlers we can look outside except Ashwin. May be try I Sharma, Irfan Pathan, Ashish Nehra, M Shami (when fit), Varun Aaron (good for T2o), Amit Mishra. Problem with Rahane, Kohli, Rohit, Dhawan, Rayudu is that they all are one dimensional and cannot bowl. Thats where players like Yuvi, Sachin, Sehwag, Ganguly were so useful. Remember Rahul Dravid, Laxmax were droped from ODI because of slow scoring and one dimension. and then later Rahul Dravid became keeper. Also Dhoni might be forced to retire from one more format :)

Yes exactly , India is playing T20I's like they Play ODI's. They Should Play them like T20I's. For T20I's India Should Change their Batting Order. Ideal One Would Be 
1. Shikhar Dhawan/Ajinkya Rahane  2. Virat Kohli 3. Suresh Raina  4. Rohit Sharma 
5. MS Dhoni  6.                7.                8.	R Ashwin  9. A Mishra/A Patel   10. Bhuvi  11.	Shami /Mohit  
</p>
<p>
Dhoni isnt as Good as He is Few years back in Hard Hitting. So he is In team For his Keeping,Captaincy,Experience. So He cant Play less than No 5. Axar Patel isnt a good batsmen. He cant bat at Higher Than No 8. 
That Leaves Crucial No 6/7(Allrounder) Places. 
For No 6 you need a batsmen who can hit big From Word Go. At  the Moment Gurkreet,Kheedar Jhadav,Surya Kumar Yadav are Best among Rest. They Should Give Chances to them and see who Performs better in Up coming Matches Before Worldcup.
For All rounder we can try Yusuf pathan, Stuart Binny and may be deepak Hooda and Find Best One Before World Cup.

The Main Problem is Not Selection of Playing XI, But the Squad Selection.
Players like Stuart Binny, Rayudu, Akshar Patel are not T20 Specialists.
What are the other Options Dhoni had if he had to leave out Rayudu / Akshar Patel / Harbajan / Stuart Binny.
India need to bring in Yusuf Pathan at No. 6 or 7 in place of Rayudu &amp; some one like Hardhik Pandya / Rishi Dhawan in place of Harbajan / Akshar Patel at No. 7 or 8.
If Yusuf comes in India might not need 5 Specialist Bowlers too.
He can be a floater in the batting order, has the ability to go after the bowler from Ball One. He can give you the Four Overs with a Decent Economy if he bowls in the Middle Overs, Don't Forget he had opened the Bowling many times in the IPL for KKR / RR. If sometimes he goes expensive India had an option in Raina / Rohit.

One game where the batting failed (92 all out) and suddenly the Indian batting is all at fault? Really? The game prior to that produced 200! Any good bowling side would have won that handily. It is true, sports memories are just as old as the last game, even among those whose sole job is the record the memories.

It's true. India need to shuffle their batting order when it comes to T-20.
Raina has been doing great job for CSK in IPL. I think the reason Dhoni preferred him down the order in 50 overs match is due to his Finishing ability.
But we have to understand that in 50 overs, finishers often comes to crease at 35-40 + overs. And in T-20, game starts from there itself if we compare 50 -50 and 20-20.
We are really wasting Raina's T-20 talent by sticking to 50 over batting order.
I think since India is unable to find opening partner for Rohit in T-20, Raina is the guy for it who can best utilize power play.
For me, my best playing 11 in T-20 with batting order would be :
R sharma, S Raina, V Kohli, M Pandey, M Dhoni, Y pathan, H Pandya/Gurkeerat mann/ A patel/ S binny, R ashwin, B kumar, A nehra, M shami/P kumar 
</p>
<p>
In T-20, You need power hitters who can win you matches single handed. Hence included likes of Pathan, Pandya etc. and Manish pandey to have stability in middle order.

Dhoni should open the innings.. Get in the Gurkeerat, Rishi Dhawan... Drop Mohit, Arvind, Harbhajan.... India's T20 team should be selected based on IPL performance not based on their ODI performance... If several indian palyers who are opening in IPL doing good, we cannot take them because we only need 2 openers... Moreover India lack power hitter both in their T20 &amp; ODI team... most of the international teams have power hitters like AB, Miller, De Kock, McCullum, Ronchi, Corey Anderson, Gayle, Pollard, Russel, Warner, Maxwell, Hales, Roy, Kusal Perera, et al, India have none other than Raina to a little extent... India need player who can hit from the go without thinking too much... just when you loose couple of wickets &amp; then waste time to build ownership &amp; score 120-130 will still put you on the loosing side... If you loose scoring 50 all out also doesn't matter... you just need to attack &amp; attack from the ball go...

Biriyani boy Rayudu should be chucked out. Gurkreet, Hooda, Samson atleast try out some youngsters if you are going to lose.Dhoni is a terrible T20 player. He has been that way since the beginning. Only in IPL he would occasionally click. Raina is not in great touch.  Rohit hot and cold. kohli is not in great form either.  Lower order is ridiculous when it comes to producing big overs . It is a horrible line up. Mild tinkering is not enough. A complete overhaul is required.

If we need for hitters in the No. 5 or No. 6, why not consider Yusuf Pathan ? He makes sense rather than selecting Rayudu in T20. As Article says, Why not Rohit Sharma sacrifice his position and play at No. 4, he is a good finisher in T20. We need solid opening combination where Rahane's consistent can help. I am not favored about Dhawan who can be replaced by Mayank Agarwal or Kohli at the top. XI should be 1. Rahane 2. Kohli 3. Raina 4. Rohit 5. Dhoni 6. Yusuf 7. Gurkeerat 8. Axar 9. Ashwin 10. Bhuvi 11. Umesh 12. Shami 13. Harbajan 14. Mayank Agarwal 15. Manish Pandey. We need one genuine fast bowler in the team either Umesh or Shami.  At last MS realized that he should go for big hitting from ball one at irrespective of situation. It should be mind set of players coming down at No. 5 or No. 6 in T20, otherwise you will be dropped any way by not scoring runs faster or getting down cheaply..... Better go for shots.........

Rather than writing about the players who keep being persisted with I think it's time we sided with players perennially left out of the team who can do wonders to change the way India has been playing T20s recently. Why are the likes of Dhoni, Kohli, Rahane, Rayudu and  Dhawan being persisted with? Sure they are regulars in Tests and ODIs, but T20s are a different matter altogether. The team need a blend of hitters and accumulators. The three players I'd keep from the present line up are Rohit, Raina and probably Rahane but no one else. The ones to come in asap should be Uthappa, Pandey, Pathan, Samson, Chahal, Agarwal and Mandeep. The bowling lineup should also include Kuldeep and Mishra. The game has moved on for some, it's time to make the changes before it's too late (considering the T20 WCup is near).

Perfect piece written by Sidharth Monga , current indian t20 team is too one dimensional , this batting line up will not scare any bowling attack and even if batting clicks one day as in 1st t20 the bowling too is not that strong . strongly feel india needs impact players like yuvraj and yousuf pathan for world t20 , they mot not be the youngest but have experience specially in indian conditions . they may not be the best on bouncy or seaming wickets now but for indian conditions they are still a handful and not to forget both bowl a bit . i would like a batting line up as follows for india to have any chance of winning the world t20 - rohit , dhawan/rahane , virat , raina , dhoni , yuuraj , pathan  - these 7 batsmen are the best for this format and between them you can get 4-6 overs of decent spin too . after this 2 spinners and 2 seamers - this is our best chance !

I think there is nothing wrong with this indian batting line up except Ambati Rayudu giving his place to rahane. Players need to be little more Aggresive and attacking. In Indian conditions this team can score 200 + in most of the cases and win match for India except bowlers also do well. Its Indian bowling line up which is struggling. Indian team management must have given exposure to Varun aaron and Umesh yadav in this series.

Mr. Monga, i like your article. at least someone has written about india's real problem in batting. but still i think, Dhawan, Rahane, Rayudu should not be in the squad XI. Mayank agarwal, Yuvraj singh are the right options for Int'l t20 matches.

I was surprised to see Rayudu in T20 series. I still could not believe.  Having seen Rahane in so many T20s including IPL, Rahane gives the perfect start to T20s . How can you drop him? I think it is not payers' ability or performance that Dhoni is seeing while selecting but some thing else. Remember Rahane was dropped by him earlier also for no reason. Dhoni goes with same set of batsmen and bowlers match after match even when he loses! By just one match he judges Aravind useless and rested him in the second. Other two pacers also failed miserably in the 1st match where pitch had nothing to favour pacers. Remeber even in that pitch Aravind took a wkt. But he was dropped and I am sure Dhoni will not pick him for 3rd match also.

India yet to find a replacement for Yuvraj Singh. He always been indias strength in late overs in T20s. gulkreet is only i could who can replace Yuvi to an extend. uthapa had done on lower middle order for RCB once. Or get yusaf pathan back. He might do wonders in 1 out of 5 matches :)

Sixes &amp; Sevens:
</p>
<p>
We are in sixes and sevens when it comes to batting positions at 6 &amp; 7 , for short formats. 
</p>
<p>
We need some big strikers like Maxwell. Miller, Bravo, or Pollard.
</p>
<p>
Raina, Dhoni &amp; Jadeja did their bits in that role fairly well for some time. But they are all on the decline.
</p>
<p>
It's high time to try &amp; develop players like Pandya, Hooda, Gurkeerat and the like. Even though Shreyas is rather young and a player positions in the top 3 or 4 , he has the attitude to play the Maxwellian role down the line
</p>
<p>
The critical question is: How can these young ones develop, unless given adequate opportunities?

Rohit's first class cricket average was 60+ when he was chosen to start in test cricket in 2013. In first class cricket, I believe he had two triple hundreds and a few double hundreds. He was made captain of Mumbai Ranji team for his first class performance. He can play test cricket well and has done better than other batsmen. He is already in good standing in the ODIs and T20s. Now, enough of these foolish negative comments. It is foolish to say he is meant for short forms only, do you think you know better than the selectors and the management? I know you some of your are die hard Pujara fans or some of you are taking a state alliance, but that does not mean you bash others. Vijay, Kohli and Rahane have been better in test cricket overseas, Pujara failed overseas even after being given a continuous run. Enough of these ridiculous comments on Rohit. You can scream all you want, he will play test cricket for India and will win games for India.

Both Pujara and Him has been failure out side sub- continent..so the only comparison point between them is their failure. Meanwhile may be he has been looked as a basher lower down the order in test cricket by Mr. Kohli and Team. Any ways Kohli needs fighter in the team not cricketer.
Also its good he ended as a batsman otherwise we could have had one more jadeja on our hand..:(

Did you ever tell this to Dhoni/Ravi/Kohli/Gavaskar/Manjrekar/Bangar and so on who fill our ears everyday that we don't know anything about cricket because you are talented? because not many Cricket fans agree you are talented enough for test cricket. Did you tell this to Pujara who is out of the team because you are talented ? Can you also tell this to the selection panel who are keeping out a few youngsters because they think you are talented and some futuristic day you will perform?
 In fact your whole team defending you because of this 'talent' tag and you come out and give an interview shaming the people who called you talented.

You have eaten tonnes of opportunities of other players and claiming you are so competent.. Indeed Raina is a much better option to get opportunity for Test cricket than you. Also, you are miles behind when compared to Pujara but being so lucky to be picked for Test matches.. Pathetic selectors..

CRICBV I never said Rohit is a better batsman in overseas. But people like you always argue Pujara is 'God' and Rohit is useless. Only thing I wanted to clarify why only Rohit is being targeted by people like you. Why you always say Pujara is 100 times better test batsman than Rohit? But if you look at the stats Pujara is a total failure outside India after getting an extended long run which Rohit never had. Rohit failed in 4 innings in SA but did well in NZ (122 RUNS with 43 avg). Still he got dropped in Eng and got one chance. The argument is wrong when critics like you say Pujara was not getting enough chances compared to Rohit. Pujara got 27 overseas innings to prove himself but he failed. And finally he was dropped in the 4th test (Sydney) in Aus.

In my view, it is a very good interview where Rohit Sharma comes across as a very down-to-earth guy who cares for his spot k...doesnt want to get swayed away by tags and instead wants to focus on his job. 
</p>
<p>
He is highlighting the fact that it important to be natural and not get too cautious. Because once your mind is occupied with a fear then opposition gets a chance to come back.  He is not saying I should have played a rash shot at that point with just an over left. 
</p>
<p>
But Folks blogging on this site are morons who have grudge against others. And they everytime bring this stupid argument about mumbai batsmen getting favours. But this is wrong. Lets look at who all played for mumbai in last decade - Batsmen - Sachin, Ajinkya, Rohit  Bowlers - Munaf.  So this idea of favoring mumbaikars is  not TRUE at all :-).

ABHI_242671 . Get your facts right. 
Rohit has scored 582 runs in 22 innings with avg of 26 outside India. In India he has scored 288 runs in 2 innings out of which he was out only once. So that has boosted his average to 37. Now its a battle for 2 spots with 3 contenders Rahane, Pujara and yours truly Rohit.

Rohit test career is just 1.5 years old started in 2013 after Scahin's retirement. People often confused with his ODI career that span 8 years (now he is one of the top ODI openers in world cricket). Avg 37 after playing 14 test that too mostly in overseas is not that bad. In contrast Pujara was so lucky to play most of his first 14 tests in India. In his first 14 test Pujara had one overseas series in South Africa in 2010-11 and he failed miserably scoring 31 runs from 3 innings. Pujara scored most of his runs in India. Pujara's overseas record Overall	14 Test	27 innings	794 runs avg. 29.40. He is a repeated failure outside India. So why only Rohit is the target? Do you guys still believe Pujara is far better than Rohit? In Tests Rohit is still very new unlike Pujara. Pujara got more opportunities than Rohit. It is Pujara who failed repeatedly outside India without being dropped. You guys are targeting the wrong man.

Yuvraj is the pioneer of this, some-one who hung around for fourteen years, always treated like a kid...delivered every time he was about to be dropped...his 'flair' which was the reason he was in the team, never really arrived! He robbed a lot of hardworking people of their dream to be part of a team, and in the end just floated away...Rohit is no youngster, he's been playing for a good seven years, it is the same story. He has an average which is poor, I just remember a couple of inning where he actually took up any responsibility..and saved a match for India...he needs to go, maybe for the time period where he can come back more figured out and strong.

He was a no. 8 batsmen? That explains why he keeps getting out in the 30s after getting in.

Believe me,  Rohit.  We were also equally tired of hearing the talent word every time you came to bat....

He's a funny lad, this Rohit Sharma. Funny people shouldn't be taken seriously and so, should be given less serious jobs like carrying drinks for the wannabes.

@11_WARRIOR: Its because of blind devotion of fans like you today instead of guys like Sachin, Dravid, Gavaskar, Kapil dev (who actually worked hard to earn their place in their respective teams and established it with success), we have mediocre players like Rohit sharma, Suresh raina, Ravindra Jadeja who not only were lucky to make into the team but have started to take it for granted as visible by such stupid comments..!!

I am sorry but does this Hard work mean practicing how to throw away your wicket once you are set in 30s or 40s.!! A person who has an average of 37 in test cricket after 8 years of international exposure in an age when batting is considered easy (&amp; an average of 45 almost taken for granted) and most importantly who averages just about 23 ( when playing against AUS, SA, NZ, ENG (Thanks Cricinfo for the stats) says he has reached this "Level" through hard work!!! I believe this statement from Rohit Sharma so hilarious that it is on par with Suresh Raina's "that he was not given sufficient chances in test Cricket"

Pardon me if I'm wrong but did Rohit just say that he is not naturally talented and again say he is talented with regards to temperament and say he takes his mind off between overs and deliveries....Do you even listen to yourself man???

So no talent either? Cause you are surely not a great bowler either.  Neither you are the only hard working cricketer not are you playing on honorary basis. Please take full advantages of the lucky chances you are getting in the name of talent.

I remember every time Rohit scored a senior Indian player( now in the commentary box) repeating "what  a talent,what a talent!!" ...
as if the other guys playing around have made a back door entry!!
One should understand  every player who makes it to the top grade reaches there with sheer hard work and talent.Time some of the seniors hold some restraint on heaping praise on a particular individual which will only add the pressure!!

Unfortunately for Rohit, selectors see talent in him and they go on selecting him time and again. If he doesn't want to be judged as a talented player not justifying his tag, he should be dropped. We can get others who will carry drinks with alert rather than lazy elegance.

This interview reconfirms my suspicion that he has not justified his very considerable talent as yet. He still lacks introspection.

I've been a big fan of Rohit sharma and have watched watched closely. There are no doubt he is immensely talented, but he needs to score runs to make the playing IX. Reputation cannot land you a place. I have no doubt that the works really hard on his game but it nothing if if runs are not there and needs to perform on on field. Rohit has to make his mind if he wants to be a good batsmen or a great batsmen.

So after Dhobi and the selectors have gone to ridiculous extents to ensure Rohit Sharma's inclusion in the team - right from keeping other players out to messing up with eastablished batting orders and destroying the confidence of proven performners - all simply because of Rohit's exceptional talent, Rohit himself disagrees with them. What an irony. And Dhoni really needs to be held accountable for letting his personal preferences and biases influence the team selection.

Its not only Ravi Shastri or Sunny who made the talented tag on Rohit. If you watch him play and you know about techniques in Cricket you will actually admire his game. Whether he accepts or not he has that flair, that style and that is what impresses everyone about him. When he hits the ball from middle of his bat then the sheer timing and elegance is what stands him apart. The only problem is his consistency and maybe he gets carried away while playing well. When legends like Sunny and Sachin admire someone, its natural for others to follow.

Ok pal, so now you say that you are unlucky to be in the squad ? You are just lucky because of the Mumbai tag and nothing else? People like Wasim Jaffer, Subramaniam Badrinath, Amol Mazumdar, Akash Chopra, Mithun Manhas, Gautam Gambhir  played a lot of stuff and were overlooked just because to give a crap like you a chance... Even Other than a 264 in an ODI Vs SL, you are an ordinary batsman pal, appreciate your luck selectors quota based decision system....

As someone said Rohit should not take it as a burden but a compliment and
strive to improve. Work on his defence. In live games he does not have the time to do it. The best is go back to domestic cricket and work on his game.
I remember Greg Chappell once commenting on Rohit's talent. For India we
need the best 11.

If stalwarts say that Rohit is 'talented' , he should take it as a complement and try to prove them right.  On the contrary , he looks at the label as a burden and trying to take cover . No other cricketer has been given so many chances to succeed . Even players like VVS had to earn their place in the team , that too after playing 100 tests . Ravi Shastri will make sure that Rohit is always in the team . Let Rohit go back to domestic cricket and hone his skills before he earns his place .

Well Rohit, your efforts and hard work are not enough to play at international level. The only reason you are playing is because you are from Mumbai. You are one of the reason I do not follow Indian team the way I used to. I hope you get only what you deserve. 
You are no match to Pujara period.

That was frank, I started liking you Rohith. Abundant talent was given by Sunil Gavaskar, lazy elegance was given to you by Sanjay Manjirekkar, Gifted cricketer by Ravi Sashtry. Guys just followed. Thing is there are many other batsmen when playing for  India rarely appreciated by these trio when they comment on TV.  As cricket fans what we want is India win or a good cricket match when we don't. Who ever scores, fight for India are the heroes. We are going to appreciate even  its Rohith. Good luck

Rohit bashers...surely you dont have any experience playing cricket yourselves.

Remember, Test cricket has been tough irrespective of what decade you played in. May be it was tougher earlier but even now it is tough. So lets respect his average of 37 after first 15 tests which is certainly not great but is a very fine beginning.  Kohli understands that and Kohli is interested in building a solid full squad which is &gt; 11 players. So stop this Pujara Vs Rohit or Rahane Vs Rohit war. It would never serve purpose of indian cricket damn it!!
</p>
<p>
While Rohit has got many chances for ODIs...his Test career has been difficult. This is the first time Kohli gave him 5 test match run and he has done well in 6 out of last 10 innings since Sydney.  Also, the way he played in last four innings and contributed to winning cause needs to be acknowledged particularly that last inning was not easy one. 
</p>
<p>
So stop bashing just because you can easily do so on BLOGs and lets wish Rohit all the best!

@WATTKIR: I agree with your comments about good Test batsmen. Guys like Smith, Williamson, Amla, AB De, Root &amp; Pujara are high on my list of World Class Test batsmen. You are also correct about Kohli when you rate him as Anderson's "Bunny". In my opinion Kohli &amp; Rohit Sharma are 2 good Indian bats who need to work hard on their defence to become top class Test bats. Currently they are good vs. bowlers who are not doing much in the air or off the seam. Good defence is the key to play long innings on tracks which are either spinning or seaming. However I strongly disagree with your comments when you run down the entire Indian batting which also has Vijay, Rahane &amp; Pujara - all excellent bats comparable even to Amla &amp; AB De- albeit younger but very sound!

I also believe that Rohit's label of "Talented" is over hyped by people like Shastri, Kohli &amp; Dhoni + Guys like Gavaskar &amp; Manjrekar.  It is purely political in this case to push their own "Favourite" forward! Rohit's defence is so "Iffy" that he cannot play on either seaming or spinning tracks. In Test matches the defence is the first &amp; foremost requisite. Rohit modest Test average of 37 proves it. Not Comparable with guys like Pujara, Smith, Root or Williamson. In ODI's with no slip cordon &amp; short boundary +field restrictions, Rohit is great because he lofts the ball &amp; is good hitter- clear evidence of Bowler turned into batsman via hard work. Rohit is a fine short format player but needs to work hard on his defence for Tests.

Rohit Sharma on his first innings dismissal at P Sara Oval: "I forgot about my natural game, which is anything but blocking the ball". Can no one ask him what his natural game delivers? I can summarize it for you reporters next time u talk to Rohit.
Against SA 1st inn: "Ind progress undone by airy drive, Rohit goes for shot to ball that Puj/Koh leaving whole day". 2nd inn: Maybe No fault ball stayed low. Test 2: Bowled by Steyn for 0, "leaves ball, and loses mid stump, what was he thinking" Innings 2 " Stuck in crease, lbw" NZL: 1st test 1st innings: "Poor shot" 2nd innings no fault, good delivery NZL 2nd Test: 1st innings: "Soft dismissal", 2nd innings stays N.O ! Eng only played in 3rd Test: Inn 1: "How abominally awful, poor shot" not my words, cricinfo. 2nd Innings: "Poor stroke really, ball that could have been left he went chasing"
 In 4 different series out of 10 innings, Rohit got out to bad shots 7 times. So what natural game is he talking bout?

On what planet, pro player takes issue with being called talented. So did djokovic complain 4-5 years ago when he wasnt winning everything  but was clearly identified as talented. Does same apply to say a Hazard, ibramovic , if they fail to score in 10-12 games, I doubt they will come out complaining against public for calling them talented. Only Rohit sharma has the gall to say "hey dont call me talented, its not right!". A Rahane and Pujara will accept it and just work more hard. This fellow says he works so hard but  gives away wickets at every instance. I have put analysis here which shows 14 out of his last 17 test innings he was out playing unnecessary shots. DO you know which one was not ?? The defensive prod he mentions above! So he would rather throw away his wkt 15th time playing his natural instincts  and we should tolerate such natural "hardworkers" ??

Rohit, this is SWARZI your biggest fan. Well, you already know my motto when it comes to all cricketing issues - that is, "let FAIRNESS reign"! So, I'm saying that you're wrong on this one! You can't blame those of us who talk when we see such unbelievable talent not being associated with any ordinary batsman oozing out of your person - we're saying what is TRUE! We're not saying that you don't work hard, but with your kind of talent, maybe you're working too hard! And this happens most times when you're not CONFIDENT enough in yourself; so you think that you have to put in the extra when you really need not. Also, it's this LACK OF CONFIDENCE that has been plaguing your game, why you're not more successful. You remind me of "Carl Hooper"; who too, was brim-full of talent, but lacked confidence which betrayed his game. If anyone is to be blamed, it must be your boyhood coach who didn't spot your batting talent early enough. So don't blame us for saying what we see - be more CONFIDENT!

@OPTO_PUS Cheteshwar was the 4th Indian opener in test match history to carry his bat through the Indian innings(he was not out in the first innings),so you just divide the runs by number of times he was out,since he scored 145 in the test match and was out only once,his average is 145.

I have looked at the above link from the article and must say, i am very perplexed by the fact that that Cheteshwar Pujara average from the series is 145, from what i remember Pujara scored 145 in the first innings and a 0(duck) in the second innings this means his average was 72.5 for the series in a one off test against Sri Lanka, as he only played the third and final test of the series due to injuries to both first choice openers :http://stats.espncricinfo.com/sri-lanka-v-india-2015/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=10249;team=6;type=series

Love you and your opinion about you bru don t worry. One thing which i advise to forget what media said kick them out of your mind and where ever you them find. Play your game like sehwag sachin and dhoni. Since dhoni is not playing his game he didn t ton runs. Si bru be like u was.

@R.A.B, Prove it by stats that he is a one match wonder. right from Champions trophy Rohit is performing consistently. Likes of Pujara and Rahane aren't even  good enough to make the ODI squad. Rahane is very very lucky.

Just read a comment which questioned Amla and ABs skill and talent? Funniest I've ever seen. I rate batsmen according how they play in seaming conditions not Indian flat tracks. AB and Amla have more talent in their finger than the entire current Indian team combined. We all saw how much Kohli struggled against out finest when India toured here - Jimmy Anderson's bunny

Mr. Sharma feels aggrieved because according to him fans think that his place in side is secured merely because of his natural talent which commentators keep on referring to and that he has shown less of the same. While the perception of some one like Pujara or Rahane might be of a hard-working, grinding batsman. He wants to state the obvious that he too is a hard-working batsman and still a work in progress in tests. 
He should however, realize that the labels are something he can't do anything about, he gives the impression of an elegant batsman to many followers of the game. This is nothing new, Dravid was typecast as a test batsman , was a fringe player in ODIs initially, he however, was able to break that typecast with his determination and went on to become one of the greatest ODI players we had. 
I understand where Rohit is coming from, but there is only one way he can sort this problem out, by playing solid knocks in tests, especially away from home.

List of Rohit's "You know"  wails:  
</p>
<p>
1.  I was a bowler, not a batsman, you know.
</p>
<p>
2. I can't bowl well now, ever since I broke the finger.
</p>
<p>
3. You gave me only 14 tests to play. 
</p>
<p>
4. I bat well as an opener, but you push me lower down.
</p>
<p>
5. You mess me up with the 'talent' label. 
</p>
<p>
6. Nobody knows how hard I work behind your sight. And you call me lazy.
</p>
<p>
7. You experts talk for the TV audience, without judging me right.
</p>
<p>
8. You judge me based n what I did, for example not knowing what I told Saha.
</p>
<p>
Unfair! Unfair! Unfair!

The one thing we should avoid is pigeon-holing someone. The media and the so called experts, since it is their job to talk or make observations/predictions, start pigeon-holing players. 
</p>
<p>
Rohit Sharma is a wonderful international-level player. Ditto Pujara. The current mix of batsmen is very good. Talent-wise, all of them are great. The ones to lose out on a place in the team will be the ones who are not in form or who have injuries.  But all of them should always be considered because these are really really good players.

He is not even that talented. He has been given way too many chances.  Time to stop the special privileges given to him and evaluate him purely based on merit.  Surely, he must be the one to go if India has to pick only 5 out of the aforementioned 6 batsmen. Just let him play T20s and if needed ODIs.

Apart from Mumbai lobby, there are few dumbos who will call him talented. It is a shame that people cannot see that after failing repeatedly in the middle order, he was pushed to the top only because of his association with Mumbai. Even new he is a liability and will only be able to score well in flat tracks or against minnows. Sad to see him getting the superior treatment ahead of Pujara in Tests, when he is not even fit to represent India A.

Many have already pointed out that sensible Indian cricket fans do not bear a personal grudge against Rohit Sharma. Rohit - also Binny, Jadeja, etc -  are merely symptoms of larger problems in Indian cricket, namely biases (regional, financial or otherwise). 
</p>
<p>
With a first class average of ~57 it was right to select Rohit for tests. However, he has not consistently delivered results and unlike many other players, has been afforded luxuries that others only dream of.  There are also batsmen with excellent FC stats who simply cannot make the transition to tests (eg Ramprakash, more recently Lyth was picked on FC form but hasn't delivered, aside from a ton vs NZ...Rohit has two big scores vs WI but nothing of substance afterwards). 
</p>
<p>
Others have been dropped for less - without favour and protection - and that's what a lot of us find galling.
</p>
<p>
And wasn't Pujara averaging ~65 after 14 tests? By the logic proposed in this article, surely Pujara deserves a much longer rope than Rohit?

Don't know what Pujara and Rahane has done excpet for couple of fluke innings against old kukabura ball. Rohit is all class. It's just a matter of time when a diamond in the coal will shine. Although Kohli remains Kohinoor.

Why  hashim amla and devillers never scores when ball does something? Both never performs when their teams are under pressure. And AB devillers knock against a depleted West Indies at flattest track in world is a third class moment for cricket. This guy is scoring only because there are no quality bowlers around. Amla cant handle bounce. We saw how in world cup he was bounced out by India. In South Africa Shami broke his face with bouncer. Then he ducked expecting a bouncer. What an ugly batsmen to watch.

Rohit is  a one match wonder. He will continue to be a liability to the team. Fit for only the one day team. wastes too much dot balls in T20 and is a big mess in the test.

No one has personal grudge on rohit. His batting is a treaat least tch for every cricket fan. I am a bigger fan of his elegance. But I would be happy to watch him in t20's and  ipl
</p>
<p>
Everyone are frustrated because  of his inconsistency .question every cricket fan is asking is when rohit deserves so many chances why not other players deserve half the chances he is given
</p>
<p>
Why should pujara sit out for rohit
Why was badrinath given lesser chances
Why not Karun nair
</p>
<p>
Why should jinks leave no5 position where he succeded
</p>
<p>
So other cricketers careers are ruined bcoz of more chances to one player

There are many player like  KOHLI, DHAWAN, BAILY, MAXWELL, WARNER, FINCH,Dhoni but no one reach 200. gayle played 50 over against Zimbabwe but not crosee Rohit 264 ... reach 217. i think Rohit is so special...and he is talented

I am tired of pointing this out to people comparing SRT's first 15-16 Tests with Rohit Sharma's. You guys fail to make the most important point however while bringing up SRT's first few Test stats, that all his first few Tests were away against real quality opposition (how about this for a sample from 89-92: Imran, Wasim, Waqar, Hadlee, McDermott, Hughes, Reid, Donald, Warne, Qadir - England was the only team with a somewhat weaker attack but a handful in seaming conditions comprising Lewis, Fraser, and Malcolm), and don't forget the fact that he was not even 20 years old! He hadn't even played Ranji cricket yet, for crying out loud! He didn't have enough FC experience yet. Those days starting out with an average in the mid 30s was pretty decent (esp when he didn't have much better competition in the Indian side itself), because the conditions, quality of bowling, and wickets were such. So comparing SRT's early stats to someone like Rohit, a product of the 2000s makes no sense.

@Wattkir You have absolutely no idea about cricket. First off, Tendulkar and Lara played during 1994-99 when the quality of bowling was much, much better than today with Aus, Pak, WI and SA all having great attacks. Secondly if Cook is your 5th greatest batsman in history then your knowledge of cricket is pathetic. Ever heard of batsmen like Garry Sobers, Viv Richards, Len Hutton, Jack Hobbs, Sunny Gavaskar, Neil Harvey and the 3Ws?

Those who are talking about ROHIT SHARMA made 264 &amp; 209 on Flat tracks, they should also take account that flat track was not only for ROHIT. All of rest 21 Players from both side couldn't score 200. You must Give Credit to anyone for his Innings instead of Criticizing him. There was KOHLI, MR. COOL, DHAWAN, BAILY, MAXWELL, WARNER, FINCH &amp; many more. but none of them score even 200. This proves that this guy has something special. Put yourself in that condition and then think  &amp; comment instead of criticizing without any knowledge.

There are a lot of reports and articles in the media that fit the general description of being   shallow. There is a lot of competition in the media and there are too many channels/websites. Responsible and honest work is not so important, but outrageous and sensational work is preferred, leading to shallow articles. Rohit does not deserve the negative attention going by his performances.

Before saying anything, let me say that I am  great fan of Rohit Sharma's batting. But I will say the lesson he has dean for his dismissal at 79 is incorrect. The lesson should be: If you want to succeed in Teat Cricket, the batsman needs to be be able to adapt to all situations and have the temperament and skills to support that. Remember Sachin in Sydney. Now that was temperament!

At last Rohit has admitted he has no talent. And he is still performing like a number 8 as he claims he started off as. And that his mind drifts between deliveries instead of concentrating.

Fact of the matter is he does not have a good defensive technique. Defense does not mean just blocking the ball. Even when executing the shot your footwork everything matters in test cricket. That is why someone so supremely talented like Yuvi could not make the cut in-spite of repeated chances. That defense has to be taught in formative days. See how a Williamson plays with big long strides towards the ball.

Rohit will be one of the Indian test greats not an SRT but will rank with VVS, Ganguly, Shewag  - rememember he is just 14 tests old.. Still a baby in that format. Even SRT and Dravids talent was due to talent plus very hard work.   We should back him  not bust him -  I think that the maim problem at the moment is that he does not know what his role or position is in the test team.  He keeps on getting pushed up and down.  I think he should bat 4. With Virat coming in at 3.  I don't think Shikar is a test opener this technique is flawed and not tight enough  Pujara should open with Vijay and Rehane should bat 5. He like VVS is great with the tail. If we play 6 bats then Shikar bats 5 and Rehane 6.  The rest will be history my friends.

Rohit will be one of the Indian test greats not an SRT but will rank with VVS, Ganguly, Shewag  - rememember he is just 14 tests old.. Still a baby in that format. Even SRT and Dravids talent was due to talent plus very hard work.   We should back him  not bust him -  I think that the maim problem at the moment is that he does not know what his role or position is in the test team.  He keeps on getting pushed up and down.  I think he should bat 4. With Virat coming in at 3.  I don't think Shikar is a test opener this technique is flawed and not tight enough  Pujara should open with Vijay and Rehane should bat 5. He like VVS is great with the tail. If we play 6 bats then Shikar bats 5 and Rehane 6.  The rest will be history my friends.

Rohit, just as he has admitted on the talent, God's gift, etc., has to admit that he has got more than enough chances to showcase the hard work he has put in to become a batsman, but sadly has not come up with anything noteworthy, in tests at least.  It is time he makes way for someone better than him batting-wise.  I do not see his bowling talent being utilized much either, so no contribution on that count also.  If somebody is adamant about having Rohit in the team no matter what, then he could be a replacement for someone like Harbhajan down the order, certainly not in the top 3 to 5.

@GUTSYBADGER: Most overrated batsman in the history of the game after M.Yusuf. A good batsman who was hyped by the media because he played to break records (evident by his last run to get 100 centuries) but wasnt a match winner. I rate (1) Bradman (2) Sanga (3) Lara (4) Younis (5) Cook (6) AB (7) KP (8) Sachin. Best Indian batsman? Yes. Best after Bradman? No. Good day to you sir

The hard work and the talent are ever present in rohit sharma. What he lacks during game play is determination to bat through an innings to make a differece.

I am not sure why the Indian fans revel in calling Rohit or for that matter any other player names or tag them mediocre. Most possibly they have never played the sport themselves at some level where selection matters. Cricket is not an easy sport, just as with any other competitive sport. Most other sports you have a chance to redeem your mistakes, but a batsman has one chance to be out. 
Assuming Rohit has started playing at the age of 11, at least three days of the week, he would have put in 4 hrs of practice and 8 hrs weekends per game, debrief etc. At 28 hrs a week for 15 years - he has probably put in equivalent of 12 years of work experience. Add travel and tours to that - he has put in a lot of effort. 
Contrary to his own claims, he is definitely talented, a lot more than most of us, but it is not just talent that got him here. Try putting 6 hrs on the field in a summer day in India. He has done that day in day out. He earned his place and am sure he will go to greater heights.

Wow, so now Rohit is trying to find a scapegoat for his failures. I guess he is targetting Ian Chappell, who was the one who placed that term "lazy elegance" on Rohit Sharma. Ian Chappell is the sole reason why a lot of people think Rohit Sharma is supremely talented. Maybe Rohit should send Ian a show cause notice? Well on a serious note, Rohit needs to start seeing the truth on its face and understand that he either start respecting his talent or make way for others.

So why all this hatred towards Rohit.... At least in my case, it is purely because of the way the management handled his case and the politics played to keep him in the final XI at the expense of players who have been more successful and shown more grit/dedication in this particular format and possibly are better suited to this particular format. This is the whole reason for any Rohit bashing from my part... Similar feelings towards Ishant, Jadeja, Raina (tests), Yuvi (tests), Mohit, RP singh, Dinda,  as they play at expense of more deserving players like Bhuvi, Yadav, Mishra, P Ojha, Pujara, Rahane, Manoj Tiwary,  Irfan......
</p>
<p>
Can any one explain why VVS has never (?) played a worldcup, even when he is in red hot form against AUS in 2003...and they played someone, lefty, even forgot his name that could not retain his place even for couple of series.... How can someone get into the WC team, without doing anything great and block proven talents like VVS? Can't stand such

We are talking about hard work. Ofcorse Rohit, or Jadeja (some one against whom I wrote a lot) or raina, they all definitely do a lot of hardwork behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>
Just because someone shuffles a lot, or adjusts his grip or seems to be very cautious does not mean that others who do not do that a lot are casual.....for example the 'lazy' Rohit... his style is such that when it goes through it appears classy and very graceful...but when it fails, it looks lazy and careless. But do you really think when playing at that level, even if your place is guaranteed in the team, someone would be lazy and careless. It could be a lapse of concentration after reaching a milestone, something that happen very naturally to all and they just need to be trained to regain their focus. Even the 'gifted' sachin told several tales of the butterflies and sleep-less nights. So calling him lazy and careless is not correct.... contd 2...

Before reading through any of the comments below (and returning to my usual Rohit bashing), I empathize with Rohit sharma for he is hated by more than 80% of IND TEST cricket fans, for no fault of his. 
</p>
<p>
If we look back and see who started this unwarranted 'talented'/'gifted' chaos, I can see Dhoni on several occasions, now joined by Kohli and ofcorse the Mumbai fraternity in the commentary box. 
</p>
<p>
Let me assure Rohit, ofcorse he is talented - otherwise you would not find yourself in the top 100 players in a country where probably 100s of thousands aspire to take up cricket as a career. 
</p>
<p>
Not the 'gifted' category is a different one, that would apply to someone like Tendulkar, for the way he flourished at such a tender age, without even having much first class experience. Now that is 'gifted'. Every one else is talented.
</p>
<p>
Talent can only take you so far. People fail to recognize that even talented have to really work hard to get to where these ppl have reached...contd..

Even in the middle, I take my mind off cricket in between deliveries and overs. I don't think about the swing, the wicket or the bowler. I look at the scoreboard, I look at the fans sitting in the stands, I look at the guy playing the drums. I divert my mind.".   This is your biggest weakness. While batting, forget everything else and focus on the situation and preserving your wicket. Put a price on your wicket and dont throw it away. You will be just fine. And one more thing......Dont play with a loose bat. Get closer to the ball and be more 'compact' in your defence. Talk to Sunil Gavaskar, the master in concentration and cutting out everything else going on around other than preserving his wicket. As is, you keep letting the team down because you are not involved in the game as you should be.

Hope Ravi Shastri and Virat Kohli listens to what Rohit has to say and do not pick him in the side just for his talent in place of batsmen who are actually performing. Rohit says he has worked hard to reach here, but he hasn't reached a level wherein he can be considered one of India's 5 best test batsmen, so, he will have to work harder and earn his place rather than gifted one for no reason.

I agree with his assessment and that's why he is very useful in limited overs cricket. He belongs there.
</p>
<p>
This also explains why he is not suited for test cricket (no matter what his self-appointed marketing team says). It is too much to expect someone, who became a batsman at 15, to internalize all the nuances which are learnt best in your young formative years.

The point is that this is one of Rohit Sharma's peers, a man who can play every shot in the book - and then some more - this man, when his team needed it, had the temperament, resolve, discipline &amp; probably the commitment to ignore his natural game completely because his team needed it. So when Sharma says that his learning from his failure is that one shouldn't tweak their natural game, it kind of questions his credentials as a test batsman in terms of understanding the game &amp; what is required at this level. 
</p>
<p>
I have nothing against Rohit Sharma, when he is playing shots it is a sight to behold. The fact is though that - up until this point - everyone was questioning his temperament. If he honestly believes that his temperament something that is exceptional then it begs the question, does he even know he has a problem? 
</p>
<p>
It is said that the first step to remedying a problem is accepting it...not sure if Rohit Sharma has done that at all...time will tell I guess..

Yikes! So, Mr. 'born with a good temperament' couldn't play out an over cause he went against 'his natural game'?!? And M/s 'Aggression' &amp; 'Hammer-it-in' actually thought - nay believed - that this is the guy to bat at no. 3 for India in tests? 
</p>
<p>
And what is, "The moral of the story is: Do not tweak your natural game."?!? :D

<p>
This had me in splits!

So on the one hand you have the much maligned SRT who claims that one of his best ever innings is 241 at Sydney because he knew he had a potential flaw &amp; he needed to go against his instincts &amp; his natural game get around it, and on the other hand is Rohit Sharma, who talks big about temperament but feels that it is wrong to go against his natural game even when the situation demands it! :D It begs the question, does he even understand what temperament means?!?

I do feel indian spectators do not understand cricket that well (particularly Test cricket :-)).  Surely,  Rohit could have done much more but his avg after 14 tests is ~37 which is not bad. Tendulkar was  averaging  ~ 38 after 16 tests, Kohi was averaging around  ~30 after 15!
</p>
<p>
He is talented (by his own rejection) and at the moment Rohit seems to be grounded and ready to  fight it out. Certainly, pujara should and will get a nod ahead of him for next tests but that doesnt mean people have earned right to criticize Rohit.  Remember you do need good bench for you to become a good team. Lets wish him best and hope he proves all of us wrong!

Dear Rohit,The two  unlucky indian players i have seen in the last 25 years were Amol Mazumdar and Aakash Chopra. Aaakash  chopra did very well in the 10-15 test matches when he played in Aus and England. Poor guy didnt have flair so when he played in India he didnt score in the next series and rest is history. He never got a chance again (Viru and Gauti took the spots) to play test cricket. Aakash Chopra deserved to play more tests. We critics think you are very talented in one days but for tests Pujara should get opportunities since he has more temperament than you which is required for test matches. I am happy to know that you are a team man but even if you play 10 or 100 tests representing India be proud that you got a chance to play for India. Amol Mazumdar made tons of runs in Ranji but he played in the era when the FAB 4 hardly put a wrong foot (2000 - 2008) was our golden era when we started winning in abroad. You are a spl.guy and thank you  for entertaining us with ur cricket

Rohit, let your bat do the talking. We all know your talent is in playing shadow cricket and you are spectacular in that. But when there's a ball coming at you, you're thinking of keeping your kit bag fresh. How about you just make way voluntarily for a real hard working player. And nobody thinks you are talented other than Ravi shastri and Sunil Gavaskar who are obvs your godfathers

This was necessary to quench the hype that these commentators have created around this player and they have been doing this for quite some time. At a time when Aussies were at the peak, these people were calling the Indian batting lineup more talented! Sachin might have been the most talented of the lot, whom else you could pitch against any of  Ponting/Gilly/Waughs/Damien or even Hayden? People get what they want. These commentators, have been feeding bull crap to them and they have been happy with it. As an example, I think Boycott is an excellent analyst of the game as long as the player involved is not from India. Listen to his analysis of Shane Warne, precisely describes his greatness and his shortcomings. I haven't seen anybody, I mean anybody, describing Shane so perfectly. But cometh an Indian player, and all his balance evaporates. So why he and other commentators do that.... because we can not take the Truth. Remember how Shastri reacted to Nasser Husain.

It was not in the 2013 tour of West Indies that they abandoned &amp; went home. 2013 series was Sachin's Farewell series and all ODIs were also played. Hope you remember that. It was 2014 series where West Indies abandoned their tour and went home. When you criticize others, make sure you are right too mate. Cheerz :p

He himself admits blocking is not his game. How can a batsmen who can't play out just an over can be treated as a test batsmen.

@WATTKIR	ON  SEPTEMBER 19, 2015, 14:06 GMT. Wow mate.. your comments made me to laugh. Agreed that SRT was hyped, but telling that Cook, Younis and KP are better than him makes your comment a laughable one.  Ofcourse, your comment reg Virat no where near Rohit's caliber is another one laughable one. Both of them are vulnerable aginst good fast bowling, no backfoot play at all, but Virat got a bit of better attitude towards his game.

Agreed that Rohit is talented. But the media hype is not helping the batsman in any way. If all eyes keep focussing on you every time you walk on the field will never help even with truckloads of talent. This is the reason why our Great SRT too keeps getting out in the 90's. the added pressure of delivering every time is not what anyone wants. We all have seen how it will be when Rohit is at his best. But he needs better temperament to be successful in the longer format as talent and hard work alone will not help there.

What he is trying to say is, he wants to play as an allrounder since he was a bowler first.

@HARROWXI all the names you have listed, apart from Unmukt, I don't see any of them at an international level just yet. Even though they are not as mature but the application one must show in a first class game against an international team (not a Ranji team) is not there. I see these guys shining only in IPL and barring few noteworthy innings in Ranji none of them has piled up runs consistently to demand a place in the national side.

To be fair to us critics he got so many chances compared to other players but he has let us down  countless times.
Lets see how he fares in this SA series on supposedly home tracks. If he doesn't come good against Steyn then we critics/armchair fans have every right to call for his head (I still can't get over that second match in SA which could have been a draw had he and Jadeja applied  themselves )

Rohit is really useless cricketer. He does not know what he is talking. He is lucky that he has survived in cricket due to all the politics in management. He is not good for cricket and certainly not for the test team. He does not have what it takes to be test player. He has been tried all different positions and has not been successful. Every time he is given out by umpire, he thinks it was wrong decision. Ravis Shastri and Virat Kholi and the Sandip Patil team needs to look at other good talent that are waiting to get in and can do much better.

U r invisible telant. Give this much chances to Baba Abarjeet, Karun Nair, Iyer, Sanju samson, Vijay Zol, U Chand,Manan Vohra and they will surely perform better than this guy. He and Saha should be dropped imidiately. We need a keeper who can bat like Ab or gilly or MSD

oh then the issue is settled! pick Rohit purely on the basis of merit.... on that count, pujara surely deserves a longer rope in test cricket ( and even in odi cricket based on list A stats) ...  in fact this was what everyone was saying - don't hide behind the non existent 'natural talent' excuse to reserve a place for Rohit in the team...

So he is neither an accumulator nor talented. So why is he in the team then ? Because he can score 264 on flat roads in ODI ?

Rohith you never had to speak this way! everybody who has talent had to work hard to sustain it... you may say you don't have talent, but the cricketing experts know that the natural timing you have is something not every cricketer/batsman have... But we really appreciate the fact that you had to work hard and fine tune it... If you say that you're not naturally talented then Sachin was also not talented, because he worked hard till he retired!!!

I agree with Rohit Sharma on the talent bit. About time we move on from pushing a number 8 batsman up the order, put back Rahane at number 5 and find a solid number 3. Having said that, despite not being a Rohit Sharma fan, I feel for the guy. The Sharma vs Pujara got a bit too out of proportions thanks to the media, Shastri and a 5 bowler policy where a tubby little Binny sneaked in. Heck, make Rohit the 5th bowler - he wont do much worse than Binny.

So it seems Rohit is saying that he is NOT talented? Interestingly, he will find many who would agree with him.

Ever since Rohit made 200 in an ODI against the mediocre Sri Lankan team, the expectation is that he will get a 100 or 200 in every innings.

Those who are gloating about their success in test matches, congratulations. In India (the main nation running the world cricket economy) test matches are dead and finished, as is clear from absentee crowds. People follow it mainly from the internet, and the format has only intellectual value now. In limited over formats which matter to the people of India, India has been # 2 for a long time now. We would like to become numero uno there, but that will take some time, because Aus is still a very strong team in that format. But, test cricket, who cares?

he is not a bad test player, he is required to be given little more chance at test level. Right now kohli &amp; rahane are doing better at 4 &amp; 5, and Pujara i feel will finally get his no. 3 back so rohit has only chance if India is thinking about 6th batsman there too you have likes of k l rahul, so based on current form and consistency he has to warm benches against SA

I totally understand Rohit's frustrations. He seems to have the right attitude, though. Hopefully, he will start performing consistently. Because, one important thing about performing consistently is not to think of yourself as a talent. That part he got covered. With regarding playing the natural game even in the last over before stumps, I don't agree. Because, the pressure is always there. Rohit should have just asked himself if he was good enough to block 6 balls in the nets. Because, if he wasn't, that means he is not good enough. If the bowler bowls a peach, anyone can be out. But, in my opinion, he should continue to play out the last over, so that he can start fresh next day. Easily said than done, I know.  It is the mind over matter moment. Through experience, he will come good in that.

Rohit Sharma has played for India for 8 years. 8 years is a fairly long time (IMO  very long time). Has played enough ODIs and about 15 tests. Tell me if he was so "talented" how come he has never scored runs on a difficult pitch or in difficult conditions. That shows the guy is a  flat pitch bully. On top of that he often throws his wicket away as a result of lack of patience. He should start practicing his off-breaks so that he can play as No. 6 in home/Asia tests/WI tests. Outside that he is to be dropped for a pace bowling all-rounder. This arrangement can continue until we get a better middle order batsman (Sarfraz Khan may be? or if Karun Nair improves).

We Indians often say about ourselves that we are a naturally talented bunch, but not very hard working. And in Rohit Sharma's case this is one point Indian press emphasizes a lot. And that perception is exactly what Rohit Sharma is trying to negate in this interview: he is saying that whatever he has achieved in life is through sheer hardwork, and, not necessarily through natural talent. I hope that my explanation will clarify the context of this article, particularly, for non Indians.

@WATTKIR..Root and Stokes sure have talent. But please don't talk about media hype not hyping them up. Even Willey was being hyped up by Ian Botham as the next great left-arm allrounder.
And, if I'm not mistaken, several of the Indian batters have made big scores in SA, Oz, NZ and Eng. Talk about being myopic !!

He is a overhyped player. He hasnt lived upto the expectation. So he is not a great batsman but good batsman. When ex-players praise him, most of us feel sick and tired of it. That tells all the story.

It's the hard work of Rohit which is showing or it's the hard work of our selector's who persisted with him after so many failures. Anyone can see the elegance in his batting style from day 1 and his laziness to apply the talent was also visible. I wish him all the luck for future endeavours !!!

I dont know what people have against Rohit. He is right that the talent you talk about is actually the hard work he put in as a youngster. The 'talented' tag has been a burden for him all through his career. He is definitely better batsman than a mere flat track bully. He had a poor tour to SA &amp; pretty decent one to NZ. He had been in and out of the side and up and down the order after that, with Rahane cementing his place by then. He has been getting starts and looked in control most of the time he spent at crease. In limited overs, he has scored runs all over the world. The twin hundreds at MCG are testimonies for his skill level. If the team management has belief in his skill, you got to respect that

Roots made his debut against India in 2012 in Nagpur, which turned out to be a dead track, and the match ended in a tame draw. Joe Root made 70 odd runs in the first innings, and in the second innings he remained not out on 20. He flopped completely during the Ashes in Australia, and was even dropped from the team. He is an OK type of cricketer, nothing truly exceptional. Regarding Ben Stokes: He didn't do well against India in 2014 in England, and was dropped from the team. Who knows, in the long run he may turn out be "talented", but so far I have seen no evidence of it. But, Rohit Sharma is truly a talented guy who has not done justice to his talents when it comes to test matches.. The ease with which he pulls the fastest bowlers for sixes is amazing. And he made centuries during ODIs played in Australia. In ODIs, of course, he is one of the most successful batsmen in team India. Re his failures in test matches: the format is more or less dead in India, so who cares about it??!!

All this talk of aggression not working is "rubbish". As if by playing non aggressively for last 94 years India have won series after series. What's wrong in trying out things? Also I haven't seen any abuse from Indian cricketers thus far unlike some of the players of other countries who spit on batsmen faces, ball intentional no ball beamers and bouncers. This team is not making excuse of inexperience and are giving good fight to opponents. Sanjay manjrekar always takes thing up to silly propotions. He ends up insulting indian cricket most of the times. I don't rate him as cricket analyst at all. Always have ignored his theory on cricket. Was the luckiest guy to play for India only because of his surname. Anyone can watch his footwork against pacers and spinners before johit Sharma. He was one of the worst.

Ok. I must admit that I too have been his critic- maybe unfairly so. 
I say so after reading his interview. I had read that when he unexpectedly got a call to play for Bombay from out-of-the-blue, he traveled to the ground. On the way he dropped his kit while the train went on a Bridge. He arrived at the ground sans the gear and was chastened by the Coach/Manager. I thought this typified his attitude.
After reading his interview, I feel we should give him his space. There is still some time left, Rohit, but not a lot, I am afraid.

Fair play to him for coming out and saying this. It's refreshing to see an Indian cricket player come and talk frankly and sincerely like this. I disagree on his temperament though. He may be calm, but he doesn't have the right temperament for Tests. Even in what he said he showed that - he said he doesn't think of the swing, the bowler or the conditions which you definitely should be doing in Test matches. It's fine in ODIs, but if he wants to be a Test opener he has to pay attention to the conditions and the movement of the ball.

If people are very fair, Juts have guts to write averages of Sachin, Rahul Dravid, Kallis, Ponting, Sangakkara, in their first 12 away home matches. Then criticise Rohit. ALL these guys had same number of centuries after first 12 test matches, even though most of them played at home.

Doesn't Rohit get that cricketers are aways under the spotlight in a cricket mad nation like India. People will always judge and have an opinion on you, for there is a national selector in every household! Why do this 'talented' tag bother you ? You should be worried about scoring runs and let the journos/public write what they do, for you can't change that about them.

@WATTKIR	ON  SEPTEMBER 19, 2015, 9:15 GMT  Ben Stokes and Root talent?  LOL . A genuine flat track heroes in a team full of flat track heroes. Wouldnt last 10 balls in India against the likes of Ashwin, Umesh Yadav , Bhuvi . If you want to see talent, nolook further than Rahane . Thats what I call genuine talent and not media hype

About time others also understand how the world "Talent" is grossly misused in his case when he could not read straight balls very often.  Now time for you to put your hardwork on "defending" the ball without looking silly. You cannot hit 4s and 6s all the time in Tests. There are periods where you should have technique to knuckle down and weather the storm.

Mr Sanjay manjrekar. You never played any lofted shot in your career. You were non aggressive saint like player. Then why was your average was just mediocre 15 outside India? Sanjya manjrekar only played because of his surname for India. Now he is jealous of everyone. Be it a bowler or a batsmen. This guy just talks, never ever walked.

why did he change his game? for the TEAM.... 
4.) Wht was Rohit Sharma doing before the Sri Lanka series.....taking selfies....&amp; was busy scouting for his luxury home...which he got for 30 cr.....whereas player like Pujara was playing Ranji cricket, County cricket, he played for India A tours against South Africa &amp; Aus....even Virat played against Aus A to prepare against Sri Lanka ....why did not Rohit play? he was busy.....

Wow ....Wht a interview...this shows his thinking and mentality.......He will play his shots (fair enough)...Now a few question for Mr Sharma....
1.) India were 7 for 3 when he came to bat.....if he lost his wicket while playing his shots..wht would have happened?....there would be enormous pressure on the team...but who cares.....Mr Talent will play his shots....irrespective of the team situation.  
2.) Players like Shewag , Gayle, Gilchrist were great stroke makers....who could play fearless cricket in any situation....they had a knack of understanding the situation...and great cricketing brains....look at Gayle even in T20 he assess the wicket, conditions, bowlers before going for his shots.....Can Rohit even match them?  
3.) A player like AB Devilliers who has more talent and shots that Rohit played an innings against Australia in 2012...where he scored 33 faced 220 balls and spent 246 minutes in the second innings to save the game.....he could have gone for his shots...why did he

Yes, he has worked hard and played some beautiful innings, some unbelievable knocks like twin 200s , 264 is an unmatchable score.....if de Villiers scores a fastest 100 on flattest ever wickets in the history of the game , all praise him but when this guy gets 264, an impossible knock , few people discuss pitches........point is that this guy has only played 14 tests, what was record of Amlav, de Villiers , smith , after 14 tests.?????????? A guy here said real talents are smith, he is a overhyped failure in swing n spin pitches.

@ ELECTRIC_LOCO_WAP4: "Smith,Warner,Kane,Chandimal,Angelo and Root" ?????? how on earth did Anjelo and Chandimal hit this list??? Do you even watch test cricket??? Anjelo is the most hyped batsman in the world! AND CHANDIMAL??? Just because he scored a 100 after giving 200 chances it doesnt mean that he is talented. Wait and see how many more 100s he is going to score in the future.

Give Rohit a fair chance. He will shine in test cricket too. Number 8 batsman scoring almost a triple century in ODIs will tell you how talented this guy is. He should have nailed his position in tests against the weak bowling line up of SL but he showed he belongs. People needs to understand the value of these guys like Rohit, Ishanth Sharma and even Ravindra Jadeja. They can change a game upside down alone. Rohit &amp; ishanth is the future of indian test cricket. They need to be given a fair chance to show the world what they can do.

All players do well at home. Only Rahul Dravid did well overseas. Tendulakrs more than 70 hundreds are in subcontinent, Pontings 80 percent of 100's are in Australia, Sangakkara almost 85 percent hundreds in Sri lanka. So what is the noise all about, Rohit hasn't played enough at home. And if you are saying home centuires mean nothing, then why thumping your chest about sachin tendulkars hundreds? Then Ignore his 72 centuries ignore in subcontinent. Ignore almost all the 100s of sangakkara.

@jtrenty66 - please don't abuse sehwag by comparing rohit with him .. agreed that sehwag was not consistent outside Asia but he played memorable knocks everywhere .. from Melbourne, a delude,  Lords,  bloemfontin to gros islets ... He made scores of 150+ .. If rohit can accomplish that ir even half of that, indian cricket will be well served .. but the point is that he needs defending from every to justify his place ... which means he is not doing well ...

@JTRENTY66, Even Amla has terrible footwork. It matters only  that much. Meanwhile when a ball turn square in India, you need foot work too. In fact a better footwork is needed to play a apinning ball. A limited footwork but a good judgement is enough to play pace bowling. That's why likes of smith, ponting, steve waugh, Ab Debvillers have been a proven failure in India.

I think people have been highly unfair on Rohit. It's not that he picked up a mike started trumpeting that 'look I am the most talented'. It's actually same people (who are now criticising him) who started making announcements about him. It is their fault. Tomorrow they will say that Rohit can bring 'Mangoes from Mars, he is that capable.' Now if Rohit won't do that they say 'Look he is not serious enough'. I mean this is ridiculous. Rohit sharma is not out  their to "fill up any faliled x Cricketers" (like sanjay manjrekar and aakash chopras) expectations. If these guys cam play for India, Rohit should definitely play.

@WATTKIR - While I agree with you on your assessment of Rohit, I must disagree with everything else you said. Let me tell you one thing, Pujara, Rahane and Vijay are not flat track bullies! Even Kohli scored hundreds in SA, NZ and Aus. Those weren't flat tracks, not all of them. And Root and Stokes still need to prove their worth away from home. As far as I can remember, Root was so horrible in Australia in 2013-14 that he was dropped from the team at Sydney. And he's yet to prove himself in Asia, NZ and SA as well. And Stokes has been all about hype. He's shown only flashes of brilliance, intermixed with many failures and yet he's constantly referred to as the next Ian Botham by Messrs Gower, Atherton and Hussain. If that ain't hype, I don't know what is!

Unable to understand the whole point of what Sharma is trying to say here. Being talented is not a bad thing, as well its not a media creation, top cricket experts of the country have made Sharma "talented". If at all, he is just trying to be defensive due to lack of scores but still being the favorite of many. It is not lost on anyone that whoever makes it to top flight cricket has to work hard much more than anyone, how Sharma became a batsman does not really give him extra brownie points. Bottomline is at top level, performance matters and not only Sharma has not scored enough runs, but he has still been pushed into the team over players who are performing. Fact is currently he is not in the top 5-6 batsman of India, may be beyond that also. Even in ODI's i have never seen him consistent enough to be always a default in the team. It would be better if Sharma can score runs consistently &amp; i can assure you, all fans will be on his side. No point in being sensitive about trivial things

I agree that Rohit is not a good test batsman but a good batsman in the shorter format. Its hard to believe that people saying Rohit is a flat track hero. Even root and smith can score only on flat tracks. Root started scoring runs once England decided to have tracks without grass. And by the way Rohit scored a 60 odd against England containing jimmy, broad, etc(in 2014. He just got to play one odi)

1.25 Bn is India's population, 23 Mn is Australia's. Rohit plays for India, Maxwell for Australia.  Maxwell plays his heart out in every match, Rohit just operates on cruise control while getting into a few fights with the other team. 
</p>
<p>
One would think that breaking in, and staying in, the national team of India would require a person to prove his credentials over hundreds of other contenders. That such a person would respect every opportunity given to him, hone his skills endlessly and possess the desire to commit every time he goes out. But then you see Rohit play and you realize its all just a joke. Here is a guy who despite 7 years of mediocre performances is: praised tirelessly by certain influential people, holder of the only reserved spot in the team, written about twice as much as his performing colleagues and a self-confessed no-talent machine. Its all a joke, just a cruel one on those contenders who will never get their day in sun...

Yes Rohit u work hard everyone does even player who play ranji also does
But the diff in Int cricket is how you prepare for the Match.
Virat went to play for India A b4 lanka series , y didnt you go and ur coach also pointed that you shud have gone. 
I have never seen rohit asking for help from any senior like kohli went to tendulkar after eng, pujara goes to dravid, raina wnt to ganguly , tendulkar amre, Rahane goes to dravid n has amre as his coach as well. 
</p>
<p>
Everyone has scored 100s in last 10 test accept Rohit, rohit is inconsistent add to that even when he scores he throws it in 30-50s. 
</p>
<p>
No one has nothing against him personally but reason ppl r irritated with him is same as to carl hooper n shane watson. U cant be inconsistent ok if you r then score runs when matters like rahane or laxman did. 
</p>
<p>
Technically his game isnt tight specially his defence. 
</p>
<p>
I agree rohit ur not talented
Because batting talent is scoring runs making 100s not playing few beautiful strokes n making 30s

Yeah, 14 tests is nothing for you and you's definitely love to play for another 20 years in the team regardless of your performances. But definitely not the case for other potential players in the waiting and us poor fans watching your senseless batting in tests and those commentators keep praising about the hidden talent despite failures and compromising other players' future. The main issue is your consistency in batting and you're not one of the batsman who can be trusted to save the team in any format and at any position, 
</p>
<p>
Take the case of Virat or Vijay or Rahane batting at the crease, at least we are assured they won't throw away the wickets so carelessly like you. Try to address the issues with your batting rather than coming up with lame excuses.
</p>
<p>
PS: Every player in the national team had worked hard to reach where they are. You aren't an exception for working hard.

But definitely not the case for other potential players in the waiting and us poor fans watching your senseless batting in tests and those commentators keep praising about the hidden talent despite failures and compromising other players' future. The main issue is your consistency in batting and you're not one of the batsman who can be trusted to save the team in any format and at any position, 
</p>, <p>
Take the case of Virat or Vijay or Rahane batting at the crease, at least we are assured they won't throw away the wickets so carelessly like you. Try to address the issues with your batting rather than coming up with lame excuses.
</p>, <p>
PS: Every player in the national team had worked hard to reach where they are. You aren't an exception for working hard.

"Started as Bowler" is not an excuse for being lazy and "I know everything". And "Hardwork" is what every international athlete puts in. Too many chances(only second to kanitkar) without anything substantial to take away

Almost all Ex cricketers or commentators wants Rohit in the team, he has tremendous first class record &amp; proved himself in the biggest stages. He made two Double Centuries not one which your favorite cricketers dreamed all their careers, All the dumb people who know only commenting &amp; criticizing others will always be back of legends like Sachin, ganguly, dravid, sehwag, laxman &amp; others compared to them Rohit is just a young cricketer please shut your mouths &amp; hope for the best

He has terrible footwork and cannot bat outside the subcontinent. Sehwag was the same way; explosive but limited.

If you want to pick on 'real' talents across the world-to true sense of the word-setting aside the hype,look no further than Smith,Warner,Kane,Chandimal,Angelo and Root.Capable of-and have-scoring in all conditions against all kind of bowling all over.

@VINAYAK0103, one day we will see Rohit Sharma an all rounder who can bowl use full off spin bowling. He will be in the team at the cost Ashwin.

Good to see him finally admit it of his own discourse.Our Rohit is a 'talent' on our tailor made batting highways like B'luru,Eden,Mohali with 40 mtr boundaries.That too against minnow bowling.A walking W everywhere else,a 'Nohit'!

Team director / coache advocating for you Rohit. Don't worry. Apart from cricket Pujara / Rahane has lot to learn. Most important is giving interviews. Any one can score runs, not many can give interviews. Rohit you put your finger on the batting position you wants and it will be yours. You will be in the playing eleven of all the three format. Others can wait.

One of  the most overrated batsmen in the most overrated team. A genuine flat track hero in a team full of flat track heroes. Wouldnt last 10 balls in England against the likes of Jimmy, Broad, Finn. If you want to see talent, nolook further than Ben Stokes and Root. Thats what I call genuine talent and not media hype

I have never seen any other cricketer get as many chances as this chap gets. And he just makes mockery of it. One of the most inconsistent players ever. 
</p>
<p>
He is playing since 2007 and still trying to cement his place in the team. May be he's influential and that's why he is managing to get selected despite his mediocre performances.
</p>
<p>
I would rejoice the day he gets ousted out of the team for good.

That comment about gifted temperament has to be the biggest joke ever. Getting so many starts in his 14 test matches and scoring only 2 hundreds (in his first 2 innings) just shows how great his temperament is to be throwing his wicket away all the time.

Indian team management should consider developing all rounders within the team, rather than doing trial and error in every series. Rohit started career as bowler and I think Ashwin started as top order batsman. Both end up at opposite ends, both are at the best in their current role at this time. why not developing their 1st choice of career also to make more out of available options.

Wait. So what are you saying? You're not talented enough or God gifted so he can play lame shots and get out and still be in the team?

But the fact is that this "perception" alone has carried him so long...so it works both ways.

Rohit is right. There is nothing like natural talent, talent need to backed by immense hard work. One become talented after hard work and dedication over the period of time. He already proved his worth in this game, so we should stop judging someone with excellent batting records. He is one of the indian cricketing legend of future.

The fundamental question is how he has performed wrt to his peers in his first 15 tests- and I have already shown how he has been just as good as everyone else except Rahane and Pujara.  At least in this aspect you can't argue others including kohli had different set of bowler. 
The bigger question is how someone with FC average of 55+ (Rohit and Rahane) were not included into test team and instead you had folks with average &lt; 50 (Dhawan, Kohli, Vijay etc.) given preference over them???? How is that someone like Raina was allowed to playeed to 18 tests (he had ducks in last 5 of his 7 innings) - including the test where  he replaced Puraja's place???  The question is not if its Pujara vs. Rohit  but whether Rohit is among top 5 test batsmen in the country -and based on evidence provided  by me and considering his First Class and Intl  stats - he definitely is.   I think its time either Dhawan or Vijay make space for Rohit and Pujara

What nonsense? lazy elegance!!! Who the hell asked him to be lazy and how can a negative word lazy go together with elegance? Fact is, Rohit doesn't deserve his place in the test team and he's only denying opportunities for other deserving players with better technique and temperament for test cricket. He's nothing but a liability to the team on current form and deserves to be kicked out....

Sorry Sanjay, when a player like Rohit Sharma buys a Rs. 30 Crore apartment in Mumbai, it is the public that is paying him for it - we need to see some remote correlation between a player's earnings and his capabilities.  Unfortunately, in today's low standards in Indian cricket, commentators such as Gavaskar, Shastri (before his current avatar), Manjrekar, etc. cannot voice objectivity, if they have any expert opinion at all.  The only folks who can be critical of players are those who are not on the BCCI payroll - Bedi, Kapil Dev, etc. or readers like us.   Contrast this with the high quality of commentary in the recent Ashes series - Gower, Hussain, Botham, etc.  Rohit Sharma is not Test material - picking a One-day player to play Tests is a dangerous fallacy - the converse often makes sense i.e., having a Dravid or a Pujara in a One-Day side when there is often the risk that a side may not last 50 overs, something the Indian team has often demonstrated even in Tests.

This is for the people like Shastry, Kohli, Gavaskar, Manjrekar and Bangar, the more you support Rohit the more damage you are causing to him as the more number of fans turn  into Rohit haters. No doubt Rohit is the cynosure of all eyes when he is on song, but lack of temperament to play longer format is the reason most of us are not fond of him as a test player. Agreed he got a terrific FC average. Pujara, Rahane, Rohit and Manoj Thiwary  all got mind blowing FC averages, but you need to prove it on the international stage when you are given fair number of opportunities. Rohit has failed in the 14 tests (a fair number) he got. Pujara has proved his worth at No#3 in tests, but based on couple of bad series he was sidelined. Feeling gutted to witness these despicable attempts to keep him away from test matches on the pretext of slow strike rotation.

I don't understand how 1 second innings Rohit 50 is making everyone of his supporters happy when in same innings Ashwin was top scorer and bottom order including binny has scored lots of runs, 4th innings lankan captain Angelo scores century but still Rohit looks class apart for commentators who for some reason r all from mumbai can only find faults in others techniques and feel rohit got a Jaffa everytime!!!
Rohit 50 Binny 49 Ashwin 58 (top scorer) ,mishra 39 , ohja 35 :) ofcourse top order did collapse but it was not just rescured by Rohit alone.
look at first innings look at first innings Pujara to mishra 145 to 59 rest all less then 26
one more glaring thing indian aggressive attitude --- were pujara was made scapegoat for slow strike rate in Test (laughable n pathetic .. then i suppose gavaskar n dravid wouldn't have played for india)  pujara had 50 S/R for 145 . Rohit n kohli had 30 n 40 its not a player comparison but only cos the played 60+ balls in that minefield!!!

@all simple solution to this problem 
1) Make Rohit to open in pristine batting paradises against week bowling attacks.
2) in Green conditions ask Pujara to open along side Vijay , 1 down rahane and send rohit after Ashwin
3) Play Rohit whole series and shuffle other players to say who has highest aggregate
4) Drop Rohit against SA,Eng ,OZ and Newz for foreign tours from playing XI and play remaining players 
5) Treat Rohit has allrounder the tag which he has already used multiple times in ODI's to sneak inside team .
</p>
<p>
after 50 games Rohit n Mumbai lobby would have been satisfied.

The fundamental question is how he has performed wrt to his peers in his first 15 tests- and I have already shown how he has been just as good as everyone else except Rahane and Pujara.  At least in this aspect you can't argue others including kohli had different set of bowler. 
The bigger question is how someone with FC average of 55+ (Rohit and Rahane) were not included into test team and instead you had folks with average &lt; 50 (Dhawan, Kohli, Vijay etc.) given preference over them???? How is that someone like Raina was allowed to playeed to 18 tests (he had ducks in last 5 of his 7 innings) - including the test where  he replaced Puraja's place???  The question is not if its Pujara vs. Rohit  but whether Rohit is among top 5 test batsmen in the country -and based on evidence provided  by me and considering his First Class and Intl  stats - he definitely is.   I think its time either Dhawan or Vijay make space for Rohit and Pujara

What nonsense? lazy elegance!!! Who the hell asked him to be lazy and how can a negative word lazy go together with elegance? Fact is, Rohit doesn't deserve his place in the test team and he's only denying opportunities for other deserving players with better technique and temperament for test cricket. He's nothing but a liability to the team on current form and deserves to be kicked out....

Having realized suddenly Rohit is Worlds best batsman for last decade, (on a lighter note) I am available to sing his praise for a handsome pay :P . No point arguing. #RohitLogic

Sorry Sanjay, when a player like Rohit Sharma buys a Rs. 30 Crore apartment in Mumbai, it is the public that is paying him for it - we need to see some remote correlation between a player's earnings and his capabilities.  Unfortunately, in today's low standards in Indian cricket, commentators such as Gavaskar, Shastri (before his current avatar), Manjrekar, etc. cannot voice objectivity, if they have any expert opinion at all.  The only folks who can be critical of players are those who are not on the BCCI payroll - Bedi, Kapil Dev, etc. or readers like us.   Contrast this with the high quality of commentary in the recent Ashes series - Gower, Hussain, Botham, etc.  Rohit Sharma is not Test material - picking a One-day player to play Tests is a dangerous fallacy - the converse often makes sense i.e., having a Dravid or a Pujara in a One-Day side when there is often the risk that a side may not last 50 overs, something the Indian team has often demonstrated even in Tests.

It is understandable where (In Indian team) conversion ratio is 1 in 8 is acceptable (succeed 1 out of 8 tries), Rohit's ratio of 1 in 10 is within margin of error -:)

This is for the people like Shastry, Kohli, Gavaskar, Manjrekar and Bangar, the more you support Rohit the more damage you are causing to him as the more number of fans turn  into Rohit haters. No doubt Rohit is the cynosure of all eyes when he is on song, but lack of temperament to play longer format is the reason most of us are not fond of him as a test player. Agreed he got a terrific FC average. Pujara, Rahane, Rohit and Manoj Thiwary  all got mind blowing FC averages, but you need to prove it on the international stage when you are given fair number of opportunities. Rohit has failed in the 14 tests (a fair number) he got. Pujara has proved his worth at No#3 in tests, but based on couple of bad series he was sidelined. Feeling gutted to witness these despicable attempts to keep him away from test matches on the pretext of slow strike rotation.

I don't understand how 1 second innings Rohit 50 is making everyone of his supporters happy when in same innings Ashwin was top scorer and bottom order including binny has scored lots of runs, 4th innings lankan captain Angelo scores century but still Rohit looks class apart for commentators who for some reason r all from mumbai can only find faults in others techniques and feel rohit got a Jaffa everytime!!!
Rohit 50 Binny 49 Ashwin 58 (top scorer) ,mishra 39 , ohja 35 :) ofcourse top order did collapse but it was not just rescured by Rohit alone.
look at first innings look at first innings Pujara to mishra 145 to 59 rest all less then 26
one more glaring thing indian aggressive attitude --- were pujara was made scapegoat for slow strike rate in Test (laughable n pathetic .. then i suppose gavaskar n dravid wouldn't have played for india)  pujara had 50 S/R for 145 . Rohit n kohli had 30 n 40 its not a player comparison but only cos the played 60+ balls in that minefield!!!

@all simple solution to this problem 
1) Make Rohit to open in pristine batting paradises against week bowling attacks.
2) in Green conditions ask Pujara to open along side Vijay , 1 down rahane and send rohit after Ashwin
3) Play Rohit whole series and shuffle other players to say who has highest aggregate
4) Drop Rohit against SA,Eng ,OZ and Newz for foreign tours from playing XI and play remaining players 
5) Treat Rohit has allrounder the tag which he has already used multiple times in ODI's to sneak inside team .
</p>
<p>
after 50 games Rohit n Mumbai lobby would have been satisfied.

Itseems the indian government has given the files of rohit sharma to CBI to find out where his talent is hidden. Even after so many years, we havent seen his talent yet.
Its so confusing why are we so adamant in retaining rohit sharmat. The entire team composition is change just to incorporate him in the team. Batting shuffles are made impacting other players like rahane to make sure rohit scores some runs at no.5. I feel its really crazy. No other international team would do these type of insane things focusing on one player who is never consistent.

Contd - I just want to answer my questions asked by folks below
My comparison with Sachin was just to point out that averages can change rapidly and you don't drop someone simply based on initial tests - as long as batsmen is playing well and with confidence and not looking like fish out of water.
Also given stop-gap chances he got, Rohit is not performance any badly as compared to his peers Dhawan/Kolhi/Vijay (all face same set of bowlers). 
SAAGARCHITKARA talked about Hick and RamPrakash - while they were unsuccessful in Intl cricket - they still played 63 and 52 test respectively - they were not dropped  just aft
To other asking about big contributions - please check his debut test itself - he rescued  India from 83/5 to reach 453 with his 177 and helped India win an innings. 
Pujara did have bad series in Eng/Aus in spite playing almost all test - while at same time Rohit did pretty good in ODI - last 2 years his avg is 53. So it was natural given this FC record to Rohit a chancce.

Let me start by saying that I am also big fan on Pujara and I believe he should open in place of Dhawan or Vijay. And I am very positive that will happen pretty soon.
I wonder where the anger was when Dhoni was forcefully including his buddies Raina, Jadeja and Vijay at expense of Rahane and even Rohit. Similarly,  Vijay - also from CSK - in 22 tests from Nov 2008 until Apr 2014 (full 5.5 years after he made debut) had average of 35.24 and yet he was persisted. Only in last 1.5 year he has done anything of value. 
The point I am trying to make - backed by full stats - is that Rohit  deserves his chances in the tests just on his FC performance and  just 14 tests (12 of which abroad in-and-out of team) are simply not good to discard him. Many undeserved players like Raina were given extended run by Dhoni - remember Pujara was dropped in Aus and was replaced by of all people by Raina! Where was the anger then? Please publish.

@BHUSHANB	ON  SEPTEMBER 9, 2015, 14:19 GMT. I too feel that Rahane will be under pressure to do good in every match he plays, just because our great captain, director and others want to play Rohit. If Rahane doesnt play well in 2 or 3 innings and rohit scores one 50, he will be given the no 5 slot. Rahane , for his nature, may succumb to the pressure. I wish all of can do a protest etc to give no 3 to pujara, no 5 to Rahane, till they REALLY fail to deliver.

I echo @bhushanB's comments. We do enjoy Rohit batting, but until he grits it out with some odd-defying, match saving, or match winning knocks (for crying out loud, Tendulkar wasn't even 20 when he already scored a 4th innings 100 that saved us the Manchester test in 1990), and gets in on merit and merit alone, we're just not ready to back him a 100%. Neither can we sit idly and let the parochial mgmt team back him over quality players like Pujara who is already averaging 50! It makes no cricketing sense whatsoever. Even Boycott and Dravid say so (about Pujara and Rahane respectively). The people's voices must be heard.

@gdalvi: The most important point you fail to make however while bringing up SRT's first few Test stats is that all his first few Tests were away against real quality opposition (how about this for a sample: Imran, Wasim, Waqar, Hadlee, McDermott, Hughes - England was the only team with a somewhat weaker attack but a handful in seaming conditions with Lewis, Fraser, Malcolm), and don't forget the fact that he was not even 20 years old! He hadn't even played Ranji cricket yet, for crying out loud! He didn't have enough FC experience yet. Those days starting out with an average in the mid 30s was pretty decent (esp when he didn't have much better competition in the Indian side itself), because the conditions, quality of bowling, and wickets were such. So comparing SRT's early stats to someone like Rohit, a product of the 2000s makes no sense.

Gavaskar's comments on the Polls results:
"See 20% of the fans do not want to see Pathetic Pujara at No.3, where as 5% are in great support to be honored to see ROYAL ROHIT take the throne at No.3 for IND in tests. Is this not an enough testimony what the fans want?"

Long story short, Pujara missed his opportunity as he failed to pass the benchmark of 85% by 5% (have to admit he did miss the 150 pass mark cutoff proposed by Gavaskar in the first innings by 5 runs), where as Rohit surpassed all expectations and has emphatically won the race by 5% (His pass mark cut off was 0.5%).

It is unfair to compare Rohit with SRT. The main point is all of a sudden the team management seen an Opportunity for Rohit to be included in a test team based on ODI performances when others like Pujara and Rahane have proven beyond doubt their class. Pujara got one opportunity ( only because of Injury) to show his class and he did but Rohit gets so many opportunities to make that elusive big hundred so he can claim he can bat in a test match as well. Rohit promises a lot but is only an average performer in a test. How about giving younger Rahul a chance, who has played couple of good innings.

All these Bangars and Sastris keep bringing up the Issue that Pujara was struggling or dipped or not consistent. Did Rohit 
</p>
<p>
do wonders when Pujara failed on those tours? Pujara had set too high expectations with himself and the fans that everyone 
</p>
<p>
is expecting him to reach three figures in every innings. On such wickets where our current captain could not get into 
</p>
<p>
double figures in ENG, Pujara dug in the center, shielded the next batsman and even when he got out, it was either to a 
</p>
<p>
peach or a wrong decision. He did not fish his wicket every time he got to a 50 (or double figures in that series). With 
</p>
<p>
all this unwarranted favoritism towards Rohit, it is the captain and team mgmt that is turning all our IND fans to be 
</p>
<p>
anti-Rohit. Otherwise what did the poor chap do, He just is playing to his ability to whatever opportunities are given to

him. Of corse no one would say - Sorry Pujara is a better player, so I will not play in the final XI, until I become a

@DHANNO

<p>
I agree with you. I am more worried about Rahane than Pujara at this point of time. Pujara has already experienced the agony of being left out of the team, put under tremendous pressure to perform on his single comeback test. But Pujara has the temperament to fight it out even in that single opportunity and can do it again and again (of corse he is prone to bad luck/decision or just a mere mortal against jaffas). I am more concerned about Rahane, because he is still learning the trade and gotten stable at No.5 with such sublime knocks that too outside the subcontinent. Now the mgmt is toying with him by moving him up and down to shield Rohit, and this is not letting him settle down. Also I see that Pujara knows his game and his limitations and is stubborn enough to stick to his way of play, while looking at the way Rahane plays sometimes, it seems as if he is sent with a direction to attack and just carries overs the orders, and tries to attack even before he got in.

After playing regularly more than 8 years of international cricket RSharma probably the only player in world who is yet prove his head and still fighting for his place in the side!!!. Because he scores a big century in ODI once a year doesn't mean he can use his place at the cost of other potentially consistent players. Out of all those games he had played, does this one test match of 53 &amp; 39 means he can play another year or two ??

</p>, <p>
After playing regularly more than 8 years of international cricket RSharma probably the only player in world who is yet prove his head and still fighting for his place in the side!!!. Because he scores a big century in ODI once a year doesn't mean he can use his place at the cost of other potentially consistent players. Out of all those games he had played, does this one test match of 53 &amp; 39 means he can play another year or two ??

@BHushanB. Numbers dont tell whole story but they dont lie either, you just need bit perspective. For e.g. while SRT's avg maybe similar to Rohit in first few tests, at Perth he was bumped up to #4 spot (from #6) to face the chin music. Thats SRT's 16th Test and he scored a sublime 100 while Rohit for his 14th Test was being shielded from mighty SL attack! Maybe come 16th Test he will be down at #8! 
</p>
<p>
Regarding Rohit being eligible for #6, again most wont begrudge him that spot. Better players have played at #6, got the hang of longer format and moved up. Its this whole 5 bowler strategy and keeping likes of Rahane/Puj out. And yes it will come down to Rahane shortly, if he fails at #3, suddenly he will be fighting for spot with Puj and Rohit will hang to his #5 spot with one 50 in 10 innings. Nobody would've cared if Rahane/Puj kind players didnt exist and Rohit was part of middle order that consisted yuvis and Rainas. Then frankly nobody would have cared for Indian Test cricket

Question to Bangar - Why should the Critics be less harsh on Rohit? Should you not be less critic to Pujara? You cannot congratulate him wholeheartedly, even after such a monumental effort. Did you see how Sastri applauded Rohit's 50 and compare it with Pujara's 100? Sastri's face was as if he was about to puke, but just controlling it for the sake of it, when Pujara hit off 100. Even in the previous over, when Pujara was on '99 and did not score the single, we saw Kohli walk away very disappointed with an expression like "How long do we have to wait here for this one run".....Have you forgotten how the great SRT (I adore him by the ways) crawled in the ODIs as soon as he got into the 80s? Now why this double standards towards Pujara? If you heard the commentary..Gavaskar threw in an open challenge saying.. pujara has to make a 100.... and then even a 100 may not be enough, but he may need to score a 150 to make a point.. and that is something he said after looking at how others did..

Let it be made clear - We are not Anti-Rohit. We do enjoy his batting when he hits those classy sixes. He should definitely be in the reckoning, but may have to carry drinks for a while - just like how Rahane has carried or for that matter even Bhuvi the proven leader of the bowling is currently doing the same. As I said previously the Mgmt is not doing any favors on him by selecting him ahead of the consistent Pujara or by moving proven Rahane around... there by adding more pressure than was needed. He just has to do his part, he still has the ODI &amp; T-20 to showcase his class and with some good stable knocks there will always be one test away from his next chance. If he gets into the team, just like any other hard working cricketer, the same 98% people hating him as NOHIT, will be behind him to succeed. But by belittling players like Pujara &amp; Rahane, if the Mgmt gets him into the final XI - We are sorry but we have no other choice but to hate him.

Nothing against Rohit, but with 5 bowler strategy, the only possibility is to compete with Dhawan for the opener slot. Pujara and Rahane have excelled at No.3 and No.5 and should be persisted with in those slots without any further tinkering. If India goes with 4 bowlers (very bad ploy) or Rohit becomes a better bowler to be the 5th bowler/allrounder (may work in SC, but outside SC, IND has to play with three pacers for sure). Not long ago, Rohit was preferred for his bowling abilities - As Quoted by Sir Dhoni the legend himself - Similar to how Jadeja was preferred for his batting abilities.

Spot on Sir, your analysis is good evidence that numbers do not tell the complete story. The MOST IMP issue with Rohit is -  To accomodate him in the team, they are toying with the careers of Pujara &amp; Rahane, who have more or less established themselves at No.3 &amp; No.5 respectively. Rohit may be equally talented with similar average, but he has not performed with the same level of stability at the highest level and did nothing to displace them either from the team or from their proven slot. This is the issue. Otherwise I am perfectly fine with the Notion that Rohit is the most eligible No.6 or the most eligible No.12 for this IND test team.

@ GDalvi and others who bring up SRT and his initial few tests for comparison. Rohit didnt bloody his nose facing likes of waqar/ wasim in Pak. Rohit didnt go and score 100 in his first tour of England (SRT did, aged 18-19 I guess). Rohit and SRT both went on their maiden Australia trips in their first few tests, Rohit's "achievements" for every inning are well documented below in comments. As far as SRT goes, he hit two sublime 100s in Australia in his first tour, the one in Perth on bouncy strip against 4 Aus quicks made Merv Hughes take notice. You do know what he said to then Aussie Capt Border? 
</p>
<p>
"This little prick's going to get more runs than you, AB." Thats Border who would go on to hold highest Test aggr for few years until Hughes words came true. Now that was SRT's 16th Test match, I wonder when ROhit plays his 16th against SA possibly what would Steyn and Co be saying to each other :). I am sure we will find soon !!

Rohit Sharma is a bit of a Afridi (in terms of batting). He performs once every 10-20 games - but in that one game absolutely demolishes the opposition. In Test Matches, Pujara should be preferred.

@VIPINY I understand sir the frustration of a fellow indian fan when it comes to Rohit. Its the fact that Rohit only has one flaw in his game that is concentration. May be this is the reason why our great Sachin Tendulkar himself pointed out that only Virat or Rohit will surpass his records. This may also be the reason why so many ex indian players back this boy. I feel you are right in a lot of things you say we need to be stubborn and kick players out as soon as they stop performing, however Rohit and the current Indian team dont have a defined role at all. The one man who has stuck to one position for a long time in Kohli at number 4 is the highest scoring.  Also look through the stats of Kohli, Vijay and Sharma you will find the first 14 test matches these three are pretty similar in stats. I think that is a bit unfair on Rohit. May be I am wrong and he will be kicked out, I feel that since he has proven himself in other formats we should give him more time in a certain position.

I am a great fan of Rohit.  But he exasperates me by his frequent failures.  To be fair to him, he twice missed the test chances he was sure to get.  In 2010 vs SA, on the morning of the match he got injured, and was left out of the xi.  Similarly, in Australia, when everyone was expecting india to streamroller them 4-0 (at least I was, notwithstanding the England horror show, which I thought was an aberration), the fab 5 failed.  And the sixth was Kohli instead of Rohit.   Rohit once again missed, although Kohli suggested his selelction.  When he got his chance at last, he got two centuries, the first one when india were 5 for nothing against the Windies.  After that he has failed.  In SL, he did well and was unlucky to have  got out at 79 at the fag end of the day.  His 50s were crucial contributions, although he didn't make it big.  I would give him one more chance - the SA series at home.  He will surely get the chance.  If he does well, he will flourish; else he has to go back ...

Actually the previous Indian coaches were mostly ex-players with no knowledge of coaching .they had no degree in coaching. look, a good player cannot always become a good coach, e.g.Kapil Dev. Bangar and his colleagues have earned coaching degrees and hence are able to coach IPL teams and also the Indian team. Therefore Indian or foreign coach doesn't matter if you have the right coaching degrees.

Slightly surprised to see what the coach feels about Pujara. A batsmen who is only preferred in test matches, not allowed to play a one day or a T20 and even if you excluded in a test match then how can you expect him to be in form.  P Sara was a bowler friendly wicket and to score a century and being not out in the end means nothing to coaches.  Its was the best test match innings I have ever seen, period. Joe Root of England and Steve Smith of Australia they don't look too pleasing to eyes but they score runs. Rohit Sharma is a good batsman but for a One day or T20 and that is it.

Less harsh on Rohit!! The statement is full of contradictions. He made his debut in 2007-2008 and apart from ripping apart bowling attacks on the flat batting tracks in the sub continent and murdering the minnows outside, #thetalentedsharma hasn't quite put the world on fire and justified innumerable chances he has got. Infact, the selectors have been extremely patient with him as evident from them persisting with him inspite of repeated failures.
If FC is a guide to how players would perform at the international level then they should compare stats of Mark Ramparkash, Graeme Hick and Ajay Sharma at the international level and domestic. Moreover, if this is the only yardstick then none of the SA players should be in the team as they all have moderate averages in domestic cricket. 
To all #thetalentedsharma supporters can they please look at how Pujara has played with assurance and inspite of averaging less than 30 overseas he is doing much better than Rohit during the same period.

Do folks even know that Rohit has First Class average of 55.60 - much higher than Kohli (48.96),  Vijay (46.07), Dhawan (45.35)?
Only Rahane (56.90) and Pujara (56.76) are ahead of him - but only marginally. 
It establishes clearly that Rohit has temperament for long form and has done as well as both Pujara and Rahane.  So Purely based on FC performance  - Rohit should have been tests since 2010 - instead of folks like Raina, Mukund.
Averages in short career are actually not a good metric as they can change rapidly in just few innings. 
Rohit made 870 runs in 14 tests while Tendulkar mad 814 runs @ average of 42.
In 18 tests, Sachin made 967 run @ 38.68 (should he have been dropped then forever?) and in 28 test he made 1725	@ 47.91	. 
Similarly,  Vijay in 22 test - from Nov 2008 until Apr 2014 (5.5 years after he made debut)	 mad 1304 runs at average of 35.24. Yet he was persisted with without attracting this kind of criticism. Please publish.

Agree with bulk of comments.
Rohit is not a test player.
Some have all the talent but not the temprament-Rohit is certainly in this category lock stock and barrel.
Please stop the rot and get rid of him from the test side.
He simply does not inspire confidence when he walks in when India in trouble.

Hi,
I'm surprised Mr. Sanjay Bangar was chosen as the batting coach for Indian team. He was an unknown commodity in Indian Cricket and the few matches he played he didn't  succeed as  a batsman nor as a bowler. He was very ordinary. I wonder who made him the batting coach and he has the audacity to comment on other batsmen like Rohit, Pujara, etc. He is not qualified to talk aaaabout batting techniques, leave alone coaching. It's a big joke that this 'nobody' is the batting coach of the current Indian team. God save Indian cricket.

Actually the problem not started when Rohit Sharma is given preference over someone like Pujara, rather it is with the issue when Sanjay Bangar kind of profile is handed over with a full time long term contract of Team India batting coach. No wonder, he would be more keen in spending his time in safeguarding Rohit Sharma. Not just him clearly the so called team management is playing the dirty game of lobbying which is the age old problem with Indian cricket. The symptoms are clearly  back now and it is going to create more harm of the cricket in this country. The standard of performance of Rohit in longest format clearly expose his incapability of coping with the benchmark. His technical shortfalls and widely exposed to the opposition. Any standard bowler on a good day will rip Rohit's defence apart anytime. Why Sanjay Bangar is so shamelessly conservative about Rohit Sharma will obviously raise many unfair questions about his motive for which unfortunately he has no answer now.

Poor Rohit. it is because of all the criticisms that he is unable to perform. Understand that he is a national treasure. Please leave him alone and time to accept that ours is a 10 member team. I bet 10 yrs  down the lane we would still be debating about his position in the side. Kohli and Shastri would still be waiting for his talent to explode.

If my 8 yr old son ( coincidentally named Rohit) is given these many chances he will perform better than Nohit Sharma. Rohit for God sake please retire from test cricket when you have some support left from people like Bangar, Shastri and Kohli. After another 15 tests you may not even have their support

It's a laughable comment that "Pujara was having a hard time".  If Rohit is judged by the same standard then he would be considered to have far worse time!  For whatever reason there is preferential treatment for some cricketers - Rohit clearly benefiting from this and Pujara clearly at the loosing end.

Hi Rohit (Sharma),
Before hitting irrational shot, think about how many players have been left out to have u in the team (not just Che or jinx). U may have talent but test is cricket of talent+temperament. Out of the total 251 comments over here, I believe only 2% would have supported u.Fight ur guts out. In test cricket, a cover drive or straight drive or even leaving the ball is appreciated. If you hit the ball for a six, even the bowler will forget that he was hit for a six in the previous delivery. U can play your shot but test cricket need solid ground shots not the aerial ones.
It is unfortunate that Che-Pujara have to fight for his spot and every-time Rohit/Pujara bats, this comparison will come to our mind. As of Che Pujara (read- Che Guevara), our best wishes are with u. Take every opportunity with both hand and continue to fight till the end. 
Whosoever is in the team, u guys are lucky and therefore put big money to ur wicket (learn from Mishy). Our best wishes to u all.

Sorry but Bangar has lost some credibility on this issue. He earlier claimed that Rohit brings flair at #3  but that sounds like a hollow claim with an under performing Rohit dropped down to # 5 to shield him from the new ball. I love to watch Rohit bat - he can do some amazing things but he just doesn't cut it as a # 3 batsman at test level. Ample proof of this has been offered time and again but the team management refuses to acknowledge this fact.

Did some excel work  - Bangar would rank 11th worst in the batting averages of the Indian test capped players who have played more than 10 test matches and have less than 20 wickets too. I am not saying that the best batsman can be the best coach, but so much bias? no problem with Rohit's loose short making at umpteen no. of times and issues with Pujara's running and rotation? Kidding me? Guess Bangar is the think tank's new escape goat.

Bangar has turned numbers left right again :) Btw he ended his test career with a bowling average of 49 and a batting average of 29. What a player to comment on Pujara! His ODI bowling average was 55 approx and batting was 15.

Blockers continued....If you are talking about blockers in TEST cricket, I guess that was and still is the only format that needs such specialist 'blockers' and there is a dearth of them currently and every team is in search of this rare and almost extinct species.

I agree with Sanjay Bangar, who it must be pointed out has played at the highest level. Gosh the comments by people here are so full of hatred. Such an unforgiving lot. I suppose they must all be close to perfection in their respective careers for them to be able to make such statements. As for me, I played competitive cricket myself - a team mate went on to play for India and an opponent (who got my wicket) went on to take over 100 wickets in tests for India. When I watch Rohit, I see something in him that is special - the ability to dominate attacks - the way Viru or Viv or Lara or Ponting or pre 2000 Sachin would. That is why he should be given more chances and the freedom to play his own game. He has only played 14 tests in a 7 year period, first sitting out for the fab 5, then with injuries. He can be better than some of the fab five. Bangar, Shastri, Gavaskar, Manjrekar, Kohli and Rahane (vice captain) know more about the game I'd think than most of the commenters.

Blockers really? Are you talking about ODI or Tests? The only blocker that I know of in ODI is Rohit Sharma...where on flat pitches he blocks like it is a mine field, only to put pressure on Dhawan on the other end, who goes after bowling and loses his wicket.

Rohit Sharma have been tried in different positions and at the expense of other player's position just to prove that he has got immense talent. Whereas guys like Rahane @5, Pujara @3 (earlier as well in his latest comeback), Vijay @1(who made a comeback) proved that by scoring runs as well as placing value to their wicket that they're worth playing in their respective positions. But after 14 matches, no one is sure at what position Rohit deserves to bat and am sure Rohit himself doesn't know that.
</p>
<p>
Now it has come down to sacrificing other players to see where this guy fits in. This is absolutely ridiculous and height of nepotism. What irks the common fan is the support he enjoys from the selectors and team management despite being a failure.

Mr Bangar, other selectors, humble request, can you pls read comments posted by DHANNO. If this analysis is not enough to understand what is rohit in tests, god save the team.  Common audience like me and others are able to judge Rohits caliber , but you experts, commentators still trying to brainwash us by keep repeting he is a class act, he has got all the time to play shots (and get out easily) blah blah blah... Please dont make other players sacrifice their carrier for the sake of rohit.  Rohit may be great in ODIs, but in tests, please....

Why this absurd reasons are even being given? This is a travesty of a reason given by Bangar. It is a case of dropping a player of Dravid's calibre for a player like Raina.Rohit and Raina are very similar players only that Rohit has scored a hundred more..

everybody is raving about pujara century which was with lots of hit &amp; misses. what about the second ball duck in the second innings. th problem is pujara, rahane r blockers, whereas virat, rohit, dhawan r the one's who try to maximize runs per ball rather than play safe &amp; carve those eye-sore hundreds. the credit must go for amit mishra for a charming fifty which bought india the extra half an hour in the third test .pujara was taking singles first ball trying to remain not out rather than scoring runs. pity ppl cant see through.  By the way rohit has got a first class avg of above 60.. he has earned his place like others.so rohit bashers keep shouting on top of your lungs, its gonna make no difference.

All Rohit's Tests since the WI 100s. Quotes from Cricinfo comm
</p>
<p>
Against SA 1st inn: "Ind progress undone by airy drive, Rohit goes for shot to ball that Puj/Koh leaving whole day". 2nd inn: Maybe No fault ball stayed low.
Test 2: Bowled by Steyn for 0, "leaves ball, and loses mid stump, what was he thinking" Innings 2 " Stuck in crease, lbw" 
NZL: 1st test 1st innings: "Poor shot" 2nd innings no fault, good delivery
NZL 2nd Test: 1st innings: "Soft dismissal", 2nd innings stays N.O !
Eng only played in 3rd Test: Inn 1: "How abominally awful, poor shot" not my words, cricinfo.
2nd Innings: "Poor stroke really, ball that could have been left he went chasing"
</p>
<p>
That took sum total of 5 mins to analyze Rohit's career. In 4 different series out of 10 innings, Rohit got out to bad shots 7 times. thats 70% of times Rohit was prone to throwing wickets. only twice he got good deliveries. It didnt improve much later (On Aus/ Ban/ SL tour). It really doesnt take much to dissect this guys career.

Rohit isn't the problem.
I say accoodate Pujara &amp; Rohit both into the team.Both are world class players.
Drop ShIkhar Dhawan as he is useless outside subcontinent &amp; let Vijay and Rahul open
Naman Ojha or Wriddhiman Saha have to put up a match winning performance or play a big innings to solidify their place.Or let KL Rahul develop his wicket-keeping skills so we don't have to sacrifice an extra batsman.
And get rid of bits &amp; pieces cricketers like Stuart Binny....instad play a genuine allrounder like Rishi Dhawan or play Bhuvi who can play as bowling allrounder.
Rest of the team looks pretty settled

Post 2/2:
Bangladesh series, 1 off Test, Rohit comes to bat at #3, flat pitch openers have scored 265! Rohit goes for booming drive and boom gone for 6. So to summarize what Bangar talked about promotion to #3 and doing well. Rohit played 7 innings prior to SL tour. 6 times he got out playing unnecessary shots as read from cricinfo commentary. Out of 3 innings at #3 spot: Once he threw wkt after posting 50 (2nd/3rd day flat pitch where Ashwin has 50 and B kumar has 30, Kohli KL Rahul have 100s). 2nd innings on day 5 pitch India trying to save game, again goes out by whats called soft dismissal. Rahane takes India to safety. 3rd innings is in Bangladesh as mentioned above. Read for yourself and make up mind about how good Rohit has been for India.

It is said that Rohit got good starts in Australia and Bangladesh was just 1 innings when promoted to 3. Lets do a bit of background. Rohit came at #6 in Test 1 and 2 in Aus. 1st Test (1st inn) he got out to what is termed soft dismissal (coming down track to nudge) and 2nd time drawn into a false shot by Lyon. 2nd Test 1st inning again cricinfo comm mentions "did Rohit had to play that shot"(was chasing wide delivery) to which he got out and 2nd innings wafting away from body to edge behind. So thats 3 out of 4 times atleast he got out carelessly. Still surprisingly he was promoted to no.3 in Test 4. This is SCG, the flattest of the pitch, least first 2 days in match. Now Rohit gets 50 but is out sweeping immediately (for sense of perspective, Rahul and Kohli scored 100s and even Ashwin got 50 in India's 1st innings). 2nd innings now India trying to save the match on last day, Rohit is out by what is called soft dismissal, who stays N.O. at crease to save game: Yup Rahane!

If pujara is left out of the final XI for SA tour, all Indian fans (baring a few) better stop watching TEST cricket. There is no way Rohit can displace Pujara from XI for the next couple of years, just based on that single innings. Ok lets take a break and see this from another angle. Lets swap places of Rohit &amp; Pujara. Imagine Rohit has maintained an avg of 47 in his 25+ odd tests, made moderate scores of 30+ an occassional 70s in the last few series, left out of team, because of a TALENTED Pujara who has a carrer avg of 37 slotted at No.3, then moved down to No.5 due to failure. Now Rohit finally gets an opportunity to bat at top, a stop gap role due to injury...and bats through the innings, makes a gritty 145 and wins a test for India, a Test series win after 20+ years in SL and do n't know a test series in how many years away.........
What would Sunil Gavaskars, Ravi Sastris, Bangars would be preaching....? Do you still think they will support Pujara over Rohit in that case?

Is it a coincidence that 2 Sharmas debuted for India on tour of Aus in 2007-08? Both showed tremendous potential and have only been playing based on that potential for so long without being the leader of the pack.One is a batsman and other bowler but their performances over the years have been immatured, inconsistent and left much to be desired. Still batting and bowling coaches rave about them as if they are Sachin and Zaheer re-incarnated. Height of backing players which has become a joke for Indian fans like us.

a test avg of 37, whether its your first 13 or last 13 tests, for a specialist batsman, especially when you are only playing five, is, I am sorry, completely acceptable. a test avg of 49, for Michael Clarke at his worst, was not acceptable to CA, then why does the bcci, with luminous alumnus like Sachin and rahul etc, persist with this clown? virat was in the under 19team when rohit won the T20 world cup. I think that speaks volumes about the stagnation of the talent of Mr sharma, that probably only archaeologists could uncover.

I sincerely believe I am a more talented batsman than sachin tendulkar. but when I got the chance(s), I failed miserably. which is why I am watching cricket on the tele, in spite of the talent I possess. Mr. rohit sharma, take a page out of my book, and do us TV cricket watchers a huge favour.

nonsense, Mr. bangar. yes, if your avg in your first 13 tests (assuming you have played that many) are compared to rohit, then rohit might fare better. but the number of runs scored by rohit must also be compared with the number of runs scored by other Indian batsman in the same 13 tests. and if you are trying to make out a case for rohit to be preferred over pujara, well in that case, I do not want to dignify your statement with a response

On bowler friendly wickets and test matches, it's more important to face as many deliveries as possible than rotating strikes... esp, during the first innings. Style &amp; showmanship counts to nothing it is doesn't help to contribute to the team's success. Perseverance and commitment to craft a big innings in test is very important and that's what Pujara has chosen in his career. In contrast, we have seen Rohit throwing away his wicket countless times after settling into position to make a big score. Temperament is more crucial for a test batsman than anything else. That's exactly what England showed when they last played on Indian wickets.

That's exactly what England showed when they last played on Indian wickets.

lets clone rohit and play him 1-5.  Rohit 1 , Rohit 2 , Rohit 3 , Rohit 4, Rohit 5. I think Shastri, Bangar, Sunny and Manjrekar will all attain Nirvana.  Easy, What class,....so much time to play.... Kohli, it is all about team composition. the best 5 batsmen play. Rohit 1-5 are the best. Everyone else,  Kohli cant play balls on the 4th stump outside off, Pujara cant rotate. Vijay not as good as Rohit 1. Dhawan does not play as classily as Rohit 2. Rohit 5 better than Rahane.  Just play Rohit. Lets drop everyone. go easy critics. We will only play Rohit...

Every one is going hard at Rohit, for no fault of his. He is doing his job, as a batsman to the best of his ability. So why is everyone going hard at him.. the fault is not with him, but with whoever selects the final X1. For all his talent, Rohit can only be the No.6 batsman in the team, as the first 5 are automatic selections (Unless he wants to open in which case he can probably compete with Dhawan). 
</p>
<p>
Vijay, Dhawan, Pujara, Kohli &amp; Rahane have more or less made them their slots and Rohit has to start at No.6 (if available - with 5 bowlers there is no 6th batsman). Unfortunately for Rohit (fortunately for IND, as they need 5 bowlers are our bowlers are not world class to get 20 wickets in a test) there is no No.6 position, so he just has to wait for his chance - may be via injury or personal reasons or real flop show (Like Kohli's ENG series - but from someone other than Kohli - you know why).
</p>
<p>
So Rohit keep doing what you do the best and hope for some luck. All the best.

India doesnot have a McGrath-Gillespie-Warne sort of attack to take 20 wickets with 4 bowlers! Nor do we have a Flintoff-Kallis-Klusener-Pollock sort of allrounders. 6 batsmen is just too defensive!

It is surprising that Bangar had to cavil about Pujara's strike rotation. On one hand he wanted to be seemed as a guy praising Pujara's century and but at the same time didn't let go an opportunity to criticize his strike rotation. The same Bangar praised Rohit's half centuries, but couldn't find any fault with Rohit to carp about and to top it off he was advising us to be patient with Rohit. Wow..this guy is something.

Rohit must bat at No:6 for the next few years. Simple. Why do you need 5 bowlers in a test match ? Why not 6 ? The point is batsman get just one chance . If they get out they are done. So it is pure commonsense that you need 6 batsman. I would prefer one of them to be all rounder but that's not the case. So just leave that. Ojha at 7 as WK. Then play 3 seamers/1 spinner out of Asia and 2 seamers/2spinners in Asia. Simple. These 4 bowlers have all the time in the world to get the wickets. 5th bowler cannot do any magic. Harbhajan in the first test and Binny in the next 2 did not do any magic for GOD sake.

It's extra funny because on a pitch with a little bit of juice where the Indian order collapsed spectacularly Pujara scored a huge match winning century, one I really enjoyed watching. If I remember correctly, Rohit looked pretty clueless in the first innings and managed to get out just before lunch twice in the same test. They batted together, on the same pitch, against a very new cricket ball, and one failed miserably and the other succeeded spectacularly. Obviously the prudent selection choice is to stick with the guy who failed. He just got unlucky. The guy who succeeded clearly got lucky and doesn't have Rohit's talent. And I'm a purple giraffe.

I think Mr bangar made a fair point. Agreed rohit could have done better than what he has achieved till now. having said that he's a long term prospect &amp; the selectors are right in backing him. What baffles me is the bitterness among the keyboard commentators when it comes to rohit. chill guys, he's acknowleged as one of the best prospects by many former greats across the globe. some players are slow to start &amp; once they gain steam they just jet off. hope rohit does the same. he's definitely got the class. cheers !

I am bit shy to say but secretly, I am big fan of Rohit Sharma. He is very spectacular, especially when the batting conditions support his lazy elegance. He can be very dominating on slower tracks, like in sub-continent. I always wish him to perform to his potential.
</p>
<p>
However, when it comes to TEST cricket, regard less of where it is being played, I don't rate anyone above Pujara (forgive the exaggeration, but mean almost the same). Regard less of where it being played.

If Kohli wants Rohit in the team and at the same time wants to go with 5 bowlers then Kohli should drop himself from the team and hand over the captaincy to Rohit. Because Pujara at 3 is irrefutable. Rahane has been doing good at 5 and so are Vijay and Dhawan as openers. So the only spot that can be bestowed on Rohit is India captain's No.4. If Kohli insists on having Rohit in the team at the cost of Pujara, then one day he will find himself out of the team as bad Karma will get him.

@KRUNS	 Why any other player is not getting chance like him for 8 years without performing ,what he did in world cup where s the flair and talent.Is there no talent ,we are all hating him because he is stopping pujara to get a place in the side ,see after a match winning century in a green pitch ,they are saying still rohit is best,give me one instance where he is best in test match or even odi when it matters.

What amuses me the most is that when articles like these come up, all Indian fans are quick to start criticising EVERYTHING and EVERYONE in Indian cricket. And when articles like these come up about Pakistani players like this, Pakistani fans are quick to do the same. But when an article starts talking about Pak-Indian relations, regardless of whether or not it is referring to who is the better team, both fans start saying the other team is worse.

This shows the support Rohit has with the support staff including I guess selectors. Pujara can hit a hundred  but still worry about this place. I don't care if they want to pick Rohit but Pujara has to be in the team. There is no such pitch that suits rohit better than pujara. People like Rohit and Ishant play one match after 20 matches. No other player would last so long without tremendous support. He is not even as good as Kohli who was also shifted from his position.

Bangar lost my respect. First of all Bangar you were an average batsman at international level. I wonder how you became Indian batting coach. Stop justifying Rohit is better than Pujara. Are you seriously talking about strike rotation in Test cricket and saying Pujara is putting pressure on other batsmen, you got to be kidding me. Glad you were not the batting coach when Dravid was there, you might have dropped Dravid Maybe you really don't know what test cricket is about. Pujara is having tough time and is struggling. This is utter nonsense.

@September 8, 2015, 7:46 GMT Haha, tell me about it. If there's one thing I didn't think India lacked it was a stable of supremely talented former batsmen who could be batting coaches. For India's batting coach to be some guy I've never heard of seems.... odd. As for the Pujara vs Rohit argument I don't think it's even worth commenting. Rohit's a short form cricketer, Pujara's a real test batsman, that's the facts. You don't even need to know either player, if you just clicked their names at the top of this article and saw the numbers in tests it's clear cut. Numbers don't always tell the whole story but in the case of Pujara and Rohit the gulf is so gigantic that it's plain for all to see. Bangar even rounded up Rohit's average from 37.82 to 40 as though 40 is good. So what then of Pujara's 49.28 Mr Bangar?

None of the Rohit critics here dispute his position in the ODI side. But test cricket is a different ball game and Rohit is not made for it. If Rohit was such a talent we would not be debating about this after 14 tests. Someone else would have sealed his spot. If not Pujara give opportunity to someone else.

Mr Banger - Its clearly visible that Pujara, who played match winning knock in last test and won India first away win since 2011, is 100 times batter then Sharma @ no 3. if but still Sharma is best bat for you then play pujara @ 3 and Sharma to the position you want.

Bangar needs to ask BCCI to get ICC make boundaries at around 65-70 meters, for all matches involving India, to make sure Rohit can play his flamboyant style of cricket and make a record of double-centuries. 
That's the only way he'll be the best cricketer since Don.

I just couldn't figure out a reason why Rohit is getting all the privileges. In test cricket, you ask Rahane to sacrifice his no. 5 position just so that Rohit could score some more runs in spite of the fact that Rahane was doing good there. Can you ask Rohit to sacrifice his opening position in ODI's and bat at number.4 so that Rahane could score more runs as an opener?

Bangar is India's batting coach? On what credentials pray? He was a bits and pieces player himself. Take nothing away from Bangar the player - he was a stalwart in Ranaji, a dogged batsman of the "all grit, little talent" variety and a guy who could bowl gentle medium pace and swing when the conditions were good. But, a batting coach? Seriously?

Mr Bangar, can you give one right reason to go easy on Rohit?? He scored 800 runs etc, he got starts etc are just useless reasons. After playing 14-15 tests, if you dont score 800 runs, what is the use?? Why dont you tell selectors to go easy on Pujara and others who were just given 2 or 3 chances? After moving down to 5, Rohit did well??, at whose expense? Rahane is the scape goat here. Rahane who was playing superbly at 5 was asked to do well at 3 too, he did well in one innings at that position. Come one Bangar, whom are you trying to fool? Audience has got minimum knowledge who can do basic judgement of a batsman looking at the way he plays various suitations. Rohit can not do well in tests, he doesnt have the shots, skill to do well. Please dont block players like Pujara, Rahane for the sake of Rohit. Please...

Pujara and Bangar are two different players. Pujara is the top order No.3 and needs to be encouraged to fill that role. I think that Rohit is a lower order test player and the perfect No.6.  But he does do well in ODIs at the top of the order. It is Bangar's job to encourage him to show more defense. he needs to be more composed in managing the line of the ball and get his defense in order.

Here is the comparison that Sanjay Bangar should see. Rohit after 14 tests: 870 runs, average 37.82, centuries: 2; fifties: 4.  Pujara after 14 tests: 1197 runs, average 63.00, centuries: 4; fifties: 3. Now please tell us who has done better after 14 tests?

pujara has to make a way for dhawan and vijay. he had got chance by luck , Rohit does need consistent place in the team. people forget he has played just 14 tests. and was always in and out of the team carrying drinks. if rohit is dropped it would be unfair to him. pujara was dropped let's me remind this to all critics

Fact is both Rohith and Pujara are good players.Only thing is Pujara takes some time to build the innings,has got an excellent temperament for tests.
So it should not be Rohith vs Pujara. If it so Pujara ahead of Rohith in tests, there is no doubt about it. Pujara is currently India's best test batsman.
 Let the selectors choose between Dhawan/Vijay/Rohith for the remaining slots.I would like Rohith to improve his temperament and defense to play for a longer duration.

toying with rahane's position, Keeping out Pujara Kohli seems to have lot faith in Rohit. In fielding and batting keeping Rohit beside him, donno what's Kohli is been going through these days !!

Can someone show the guts to drop this guy? Drop him and get Sehwag to play in the middle order. Sehwag's mere presence is enough to send chills down the spine of opposition.

To be honest there is a long list of people whom we should not be harsh in Indian cricket team. Unfortunately Rohit can only be put in the end of that list.

Sanjay Bangar. I am fan of Indian Cricket. You know very well about current indian players and how they are preparing etc. We are looking them in International level only. We are commenting from International level perspective. Many player told Rohit is gifted player etrc etc. But truth is he is not performing well in International level. Rohit has no luck in International level. He is blocking Rahane, Pujara, Rahul Nair, Rayadu etc. He played well one or two times but it is not in do or die situation like pujara in last test. He scored 2 double century but the pitch is batting pitch.  Please release him because many other player are in line to perform. If they are not perfomed well give chance to Rohit. Rohit got more opportunity than any other player like Pujara, Rahane etc.Rahane hit hundred in lord and in Aus and SA in crucial time.

People should also remember India are not carrying Rohit alone. They are also carrying Rahul, who has been a hit-or-miss so far, Binny, who doesn't fit into any role, and Saha, 30 ,  who has failed with the bat far too often. And they don't want to compromise on anyone of the three. They could as well make Rahul keep wickets, drop Binny for good, and play Rohit.at number 6. So that also allows room for both Dhawan AND Vijay, along with Rahul, Rohit, Kohli, Pujara, and Rahane, which would make it a very formidable lineup across conditions. But then to hell with the fifth bowler. They simply cannot carry a fifth bowler/Binny, Rohit, Rahul and Saha all at the same time.

I think this article is a fair comment. But somehow I get irritated to see Rohit fail time and again. The source of this irritation is that Rohit is capable but fails to apply himself cent per cent. You almost know that within 5-10 overs, Rohit will be gone. Only rarely he sticks on. But look at other players (Pujara, Vijay). They may not be as gifted. But they put a price on their wicket. Saying all these, I am not sure whether it is wise to keep Rohit out of the team. May be time will solve this.

@Gdalvi.. So, please justify keeping Pujara out in place of Rohit Sharma... Pujara had 2 bad tours of England and Australia, bad, because he could not "get big scores".. If you see the stats, the number of balls he played out, made it much easier for the other batsmen.. He had only 2 single digit scores then.. He did not deserve to be dropped!
As for Rohit, he should bat at number 5 or 6.. no other place suits him.. His ODI performance should not be a benchmark to get him into the test side! 
This is really sad for Indian Cricket that a player of Pujara's quality is sitting out!

I would place Pujara in the team sheet first and then select any other player. Backing Rohit is good. It is in him to be a great test player. But, at the cost of Pujara? Well, Pujara is the best of all the batsmen in India currently playing. He can occupy crease at one end, so vital in test cricket and still punish lose deliveries. Sachin, Dravid would be scrapping their head seeing Pujara called as slow strike rate player...  would like to see 7-4 combination with Virat kohli, Rohit Sharma, and Vijay donning the 5th bowler role. But, will the IPL stalwarts develop that facet of their game as did Saurav Ganguly, Sachin and Sehwag? And will Ashwin prepare to bowl long spells like Kumble did. I am sorry to say that cricket administrators in India have forgot that India always almost played with 7-4 combination with kumble bowling marathon spells. Today's player do not want to either bat that long or bowl so much for fear of injury/overuse of body so as to remain fit for IPL season.

Rohit is not at all a bad player per se, neither can anyone be after getting two double hundreds, but I don't understand what is the role of Bangar and Shastri as coaches here. Is it to shape Rohit's career, or to ensure a winning combination for the team. Rohit is very good, but not better than Pujara in the current scenario. Let them shape Rohit's career as well, but not at the cost of a fine player like Pujara. He can replace Binny at 6 any day.

For those who support Rohit just like how Shastri, Gavaskar, Bangar,Mumbai Indians and BCCI are doing:
Let's take a look at batting statistics away and home in the test matches where Kohli played.
Away:
Player		      Mat	   Inns	Runs 	Ave
V Kohli		       24	   46	1935	43.00
M Vijay		        18	   35	1384	39.54
AM Rahane	17	   32	1345	46.37
CA Pujara	        13	   26	908	36.32
MS Dhoni	        17	   32	820	27.33
RG Sharma	12	   23	582	26.45
</p>
<p>
Home:
Player		     Mat	Inns	Runs	Ave
CA Pujara	      12	   19	1203	80.20
V Kohli 	      13	   20	859	50.52
MS Dhoni 	      13	   19	767	47.93
M Vijay		        6	     9	499	55.44
RG Sharma	2	     2 	288	288.00
Going by the statistics, Rohit should be the least preferred when India plays away and most preferred when India plays home. He might get a double hundred against South Africa when they play home and we will forget his away struggles and praise him for his class and he would have earned the right to play terribly in another 12-15 away tests.

I wonder if folks commenting here against Rohit  doing it just blindly .
Here are averages for the current Indian batsmen after similar number of tests - you can verify using stat guru:
Kolhi 14 tests/38.73,  Vijay 14/34.24, Dhawan 13/35.78 (only  Rahane and Pujara are in 40s) vs. Rohit 14/37.82 - and that too playing most of his tests abroad and not getting a single full series until this SL tour. 
So not sure why folks are simply harsh on Rohit when rest were just at same level??? 
Not to mention Raina managed to play 18 test at 26 and Yuvi 40 tests for 33.
Please submit.

Rohit wants to open in one dayers as opening is the best position in onedayers to play.So the management moved rahane from opening slot to 4.Actually rahane is a very good opener.In tests it is very difficlt to bat earlier.So the management moved rahane from 5 to 3 to accomodate rohit.The greatest joke is about pujara's inability to take singles.Has Rohit got that much ability to take singles.

It does not matter if Rohit has class or not, it is the runs that count and by that account, Rohit has been a consistent failure. I would have understood the selectors and team management backing him, if there was no one else warming the benches - but to have Pujara sit out because of Rohit is ludicrous to say the least.

Pujara? He doesn't stand a chance really. Indians covet IPL stars &amp; espouse the virtues of being adept at a bit of hit and giggle. They rave on about &amp; worship only those who have performed in the IPL (or versus India - as if that is even necessarily that hard half of the time). The selectors (it would appear) - and certainly the Indian public - care not for technical excellence or mental strength &amp; aptitude.
Test cricket - in a spectacularly ironic stance - seems to be the ugly duckling of the three formats. Funny that, for the truth is it is a majestic swan..... and easily the finest and most important form of cricket. It is played over five days and you do not need to strike at 150.00!! In fact, in many ways, all you have to do is not get out. Indians are not used to survival and grit... Why would they be, when a 40-ball knock has become an eternity!? From the outside looking in, on any seaming or variable pitch that offers something to the bowler, surely Pujara is your man? Sigh..

I am a West Indian and I'm amazed that it has escaped everyone here that Rohit has been dropped like 3 or 4 times in playing those 13 tests. And those 2 centuries against the West Indies were needed by the team and everyone has their favourite team. Rohit played 1 test in England---dropped, in SA same thing, in Australia 2 tests dropped then recalled for the last test. Pujara had a decent run in England and then Australia....his average dipped. Anyway, if being dropped 3 or 4 times in playing 13 tests is being given special treatment, then good luck to him!

If Rohit is still preferred over Pujara, he should have opened in the last test for he is an opener in ODIs.  No doubt certain players enjoy a special privilege whether you perform or not.  Rohit is the blue-eyed boy of Indian cricket, but at the expense of Pujara.

I request you to plz post this, i have been frustrated by seeing all these Rohit haters comments, when banger said look at his average, he meant that calculate all players average when they were 14 matches old, not as on date, have you looked at Virat kohli's average when he was 14 tests, Rahane's ? everybody needs sometime, this happened to Rohit in odi'd as well, since he started opening he is averaging 50 that answers your question, he actually do not deserve so much of hate so people should actually start loving him for what he has already done, and morethan any things else, who cares what's our opinion is, he is got the best wishes , opinions who's actually matters, haters can hate him as much as you can, he is going to bounce back like he did in Odi's , Keep Calm and believe in Rohit..

I seriously need to learn the art of People Management from Rohit Sharma. Its downright shocking that he has been in the Indian side for so many years now, but he is yet to show his 'talent'. Talent &amp; Execution 101 = In Cricket/sports, You show talent when you are young(age 19-21) but you execute and show results 3-4 years after that. Rohit Sharma has been playing INT cricket from 2008! And lastly, his 200+ in ODI means nothing now(against low quality bowling attacks, unlike Sachin's one, and slightly so Shewag's), yes its an incredible achievement, but people should stop there and not translate that into anything else. Cheers!

~40 avg is considered good for Rohit but called slump for Pujara. When Rohit is good at #5, it should be between Rahane and Rohit whom to play and not Pujara! Bangar is suggested to check the avg/stats of Pujara too before talking BS. But one has to agree with Bangar that its not Rohit's fault. Its the biased team management, captain, commentators  and opportunists like Bangar( now assistant coach and reporting to Ravi Shastri) himself!

If one takes the first two scores of Rohit's test debut, his average is much lower than what Bangar is quoting. In contrary, Pujara had average in sixties for the similar duration, not in 30's. Rohit Sharma will be a liability to play on a seaming track and will Kohli. Neither seems to have learned on how to leave balls in the corridor of uncertainty.

Rohit is a special player and a ex factor when in form.. We can't turn a blind eye to the fact that he has two double tons in ODI cricket. That speaks volumes, greats of test cricket have worked out a way to get out of a slump and he is doing just that.
</p>
<p>
Pujaras strike rate causes major concerns as he will farm the strike and put the team and non strikers under pressure.

1. Dhawan
2. Vijay
3. Rahane
4. Kohli
5. Rohit

They should rather focus on getting a proper all rounder as Stuart Binny ain't really test match quality

Pujara's 145 on SSC's green-top is the best an Indian batsman has played in recent memory. To not only make that score, but to carry the bat through -- mind blowing. Bangar's statements are terribly off-key in this context. This is the time to truly celebrate Pujara, not provide inane excuses for Rohit's repeated failures in test cricket. In fact, you could argue that Rohit can't bat long in seaming or spinning or bouncy conditions. He is the one batsman who needs a perfect batting paradise to put up a big score. If after all these years Rohit hasn't been able to develop the intelligence that allows a batsman to make appropriate choices in imperfect conditions, he probably never will get there. Aside from Vijay and Pujara no one in this lineup has the steel core required of a test player. Next few years, no matter what the result, I would persist with Vijay, Rahane, Kohli, Pujara. Dhawan, Rahul, and Rohit (with focus on first two) I would rotate until I find one who can bat in England.

all those people who are saying that rahane was sacrificed at 3 so that rohit could get an easier outing should realise that rahane for all his credentials played at 5 all this while. so going by the same logic he got it easy . the arguments being made are quite astounding . the only good argument made is the one made my bangar. oh he played test cricket n none of us did.

This is the problem if mediocre and substandard batsmen are made as coaches, that too Indian. The problem with Indian coaches is they tend to be biased and promote their favorite players. The BCCI should get rid of Shastry and Bangar asap. Now Bangar has taken the baton of praising and backing Rohit Sharma from Shastry. The baton has been handed over to one from another right from Shastry to Gavaskar to Manjrekar and now  to Bangar.

Enough bangar. Don't loose the little respect you earned. its not about rohit's avg and all. rohit will never fit into test team at the cost of pujara.

Regarding the Strike Rotation, its true that Rohit got bogged down many times in ODIs and had very poor strike rate in first 15 overs let alone rotating the strike.  If you talk about rotating strike, Rohit should be out of the team first weather it is ODIs or Tests.  This Indian team management is trying their best to give excuses for leaving out Pujara and forcing Rohit Sharma to be in the eleven in all formats of the game(reasons only known to them).

Simple question to Sanjay Bangar.. Why was Pujara not moved to #5 spot when he was only getting 30plus scores and not hundreds?  Please don't be a mouthpiece for the team management.  Talk to your conscience and you will not utter these words about Rohit.

I remember Sanjay Bangar for his partnership with Rahul Dravid in Headingley  against England in 2002. And his cameo against West Indies in Ahmedabad again with Rahul Dravid in 2002.
But this article makes me forget everything about him and start to ignore his opinions.
If Sanjay Bangar is so confident about Rohit, then let him send Rohit in No.3 position against England, Austria and South Africa in their respective home pitches and give Rohit's figure which will be like telephone number.
Rohit deserve no place in Test Team. He is just no Test material. He is also captain of IPL Mumbai Indians, so he will never be able to adopt to demands of Test Cricket.

There is after all very less to chose between the two and none of them are brilliant. Since Rohit's debut, Pujara has played 14 tests while Rohit has played 13. Pujara during this period has scored 1038 runs at an average of 38.44 scoring 49 runs per 100 balls while Rohit has scored 870 @ 37.82 making 52 runs per 100 balls. But what Pujara brings on the table is a stable batsman at no 3 when the conditions ask discipline. In my opinion, if I have to rate current crop in terms of patience and discipline Pujara would come a close second to Vijay while Rohit would be a distant fifth. My solution - horses for courses with rotation or get Rahul to keep wickets and play Pujara(opener) and Rohit both!

Completely biased opinion by Bangar. One feels that Rohit has employed him as a personal marketing tool to extend his so far mediocre Test match career. In my opinion, it's unfair to select players based on their talent, more so on their performance and skills to understand match situations. Rohit has neither of these and I doubt he will even try to develop these traits because of the hero worship he gets from guys like Shastri &amp; Co. My reading is, horses for courses; no one should feel that their place in the team is guaranteed because of just talent!

VINAYKARANAM@ In eng &amp; aus not only Pujara got fail that was completely team failure. Pujara was looking better than Kohli in eng against Anderson &amp; co. Kohli had played brilliantly in aus but that time aus pitches were flat. Definitely some issues with Pujara in green &amp; bouncy tracks but he able to resolve it. He is pure test batsman.

It seems that the entire Indian cricket fraternity wants Rohit to click in all three formats of the game. He is one player who has been given the maximum number of chances in the history of Indian cricket. There is a famous movie dialogue "If you want something badly enough, all of the forces in the world will do their best to bring it to you". It is exactly the same case with Rohit, even if he wants to succeed or not, the team management wants him to succeed desperately. He is talented but to me he is the most overrated player ever and should be taught the hard way.

@Vinayakaranam -- even if we accept your senseless analysis of Pujara's performance (flat track bully), his performance is still better than Nohit's!  And that's the point most people on this forum are trying to make.  Pujara's batting average in test and first class are almost similar while Nohit's test average is almos20 runs lower than in first class.  That says it all .....

omg! sad to see how the management treats pujara like a step child... 54, 39, 50 and 80 are match winning scores while a monumental 145* on a minefield is still criticised for pujara not rotating the strike enough! there is no more clearer indication - pujara will be the brad hodge of Indian cricket

I don't understand why people are so much harsh on Rohit.  Everybody knows he has not performed as expected, especially considering his form in ODI's.  But, so far he has not given any solid position by any captain.  In Australia, he played first dropped in second again played. Same thing happened in England also. At least the present management is giving some breathing time and so far he has not done anything wrong even though it can not call as brilliant performance.  I would prefer him to play at no 6.  He didn't do anything wrong in Sri Lanka to be dropped, in fact he did better than others.

I feel Rohit Sharma has got more than his fair share of chances, while keeping good Test players out like Pujara. It does not make sense purely from a cricketing angle, to keep playing him. Poor Rahane was even asked to come in at No. 3 to shield Rohit from the new ball. It is clear that there is more than meets the eye with this kind of continued selection. I think the top five in Test cricket should be: 1. M. Vijay 2. Shikhar Dhawan 3. Pujara 4. Kohli (of course) and 5. Rahane. The reserve batsmen in the squad could be Rahul along with one youngster from the "A" team that played against Aus and SA recently.

did you get the same number of chances as rohit? you got dropped just because you couldnt make a hundred at the opening slot despite being an allrounder and just a stopgap opener; yet you made a fist out of it and scored runs in indias most famous Headingley win of 2002. pujara and you got this stepmotherly treatment because of the state u played for, and rohit gets support due to mumbai. he should be judged on the same harsh criteria that you or pujara get judged on. no quarters must be given or taken in this world. if rohit cant take the pressure despite earning so much money, send him to a field of work where he can take it. nothing comes cheap; in his case, its pressure because of his own famed inconsistency.

Rohit has been already given far too many chances. And that's an understatement. The two double centuries (in ODIs) were against a weak opposition on flat tracks. Same thing for tests as well. Whenever we have required him to fire, he has always managed to fail convincingly. Also, as mentioned by other fellow user, why Pujara wasn't allowed to shift to a different batting position? Rohit cannot face the new ball and that's the stark truth. I have heard this so many times, albeit in a subtle manner. Harsha Bhogle, Sunil Gavaskar, Sanjay Manjrekar...every one has stated on different occasions that he starts off slowly and uncertainly and then manages to accelerate towards the end of the innings. Read between the lines folks...they are clearly saying that he cannot play when the ball is new and shiny but is a bully against the old, wornout ball.

High time we tapped over reserves. We can  take a leaf out of the Australian way of picking up sides.

I would've paid attention to every other word Mr Bangar said, if he included one line, just one line thanking Pujara for single handedly handing the Indian Team the decider Test win, gift-wrapped, while himself appearing in a must-perform situation batting in the worst possible batting position (opening) on a green top, carrying his bat through the innings, when the seamers where wreaking havoc on Days 1 and 2. He would've had my attention then.

as far as test cricket is concerned, if batting avg. is criteria C.Pujara heads the list among-st all batsman(virat kohli included),
and especially for SA tour of India C Pujara is best No.3 batsman as he has 5 hundreds in India itself always play horses for courses
also don't play Kohli in England as he can't even score in double digit there as far as Rohit Sharma is concerned he is a bad Test cricketer Pujara was Man of the Match in Final Test and coz of him we won outside India after 2011

Mr Bangar is under pressure from Shastri and team management to say what he is saying. Rohit doesn't deserve to be in the test team. Stats says it all. Only looking at performance from 3 series you cam not count out good player like Pujara. Because of him we have been able to either draw a match or win a match. Rohit has been choosen so many times in past 5 to 6 years and have not proved himself as test player. Also can not judge based on one series that he is better than Pujara.

This interview shows that how much support that Rohit have from the team management. I have two questions to Bangar..
</p>
<p>
1. You said Rohit is just played 13 tests and so he need more time. But when we look at india's fixture, atleast 2 years required to play 13 test matches. Do you say, giving chance for two years is not sufficient?.. When there is another batsmen in form, why do you keep on giving change to him???
2.  When pujara failed to impress at no. 3, why you have not changed his batting order like you are doing for rohit??? Why is this partiality?... I say with this technique you are spoiling Rahane's career also by pushing him to bat at no 3...

Rohit has more international experience, has been given chance and time in every format. Thatso why people are harsh on him to perform in test. He has been long enough and needs to figure it out. That said, I believe in him a lot. Amazing talent and hard worker. India needs him. Haven't yet seen anyone better. Actually sanju Samson and Rohit should work together. They will surprise us a lot soon.

Utter nonsense.. Bangaru Adigal is the latest blind supporter of the wonder-boy-'No'Hit Sharma. Am still wondering when this wonder-boy-'No'Hit Sharma will unleash his so called 'talent' ?? Even in ODI's he needs to face 100+ deliveries to match his strike rate to 100. Till then he is only second best to tortoise. I could never recollect a match where India had a blazing start in ODI's because of wonder-boy-'No'Hit Sharma. All good memories are from Sehwag &amp; Sachin and to an extent when Uthappa was opening.
Am wondering when the team management &amp; Kohli gonna realize that investing on wonder-boy-'No'Hit Sharma  for team's test future is a blunder. 
Always play Rahane @ 5 &amp; Pujara @ no. 3 for the teams best future.

guys who are criticizing Rohit doesn't know anything about cricket...someone told here that he has scored his 2 test hundreds in India..so in your case pujara scored his 7 hundreds away from India???... guys stop criticizing ...pujara scored 5 of his 7 hundreds in India..and 6 in subcontinent... and his only century away from subcontinent came way back in 2013...and he struggled to get runs in newzeland, england and Australia..and later he went to county and played some nonsense cricket there and you say he scored hundred in england...he is flat track bully...and some guys here say he has solid technique and temperament...where has this gone when he batted in England, newzeland and Australia..u keep on saying he is another dravid..he ll get loads of runs... he got two double hundreds...check when he had made debut for India in tests way back in 2010 and even now he is fighting for his place in team ...and u guys say he s born to get a place in play XI...if he has that techinque ask him to score outside subcontinent ..and then criticize Rohit Sharma...

guys who are criticizing Rohit doesn't know anything about cricket...someone told here that he has scored his 2 test hundreds in India..so in your case pujara scored his 7 hundreds away from India???... guys stop criticizing ...pujara scored 5 of his 7 hundreds in India..and 6 in subcontinent... and his only century away from subcontinent came way back in 2013...and he struggled to get runs in newzeland, england and Australia..and later he went to county and played some nonsense cricket there and you say he scored hundred in england...he is flat track bully...and some guys here say he has solid technique and temperament...where has this gone when he batted in England, newzeland and Australia..u keep on saying he is another dravid..he ll get loads of runs... he got two double hundreds...check when he had made debut for India in tests way back in 2010 and even now he is fighting for his place in team ...and u guys say he s born to get a place in play XI...if he has that techinque ask him to score outside subcontinent ..and then criticize Rohit Sharma...

Sanjay Bangar: Look at the away performance of Rohit.  12 tests; 582 runs; 26.45 average; No century.  Defend that.  Furthermore defend this perforamance over Pujara.  You are just part of an establishment that wants Rohit to be there.  Gavaskar, Shastri, Kohli you have a lackey now in Bangar.

Very good interview. For those criticizing how Bangar was not a good player himself, aren't you assuming only good players become good coaches? I like the fact that our bowling, fielding and batting coaches are give specific examples of changes that have been made or being made, we have not heard that from the previous set of coaches enough on this. I can see an improvement already in slip and other close field catching which has been a major factor in Indian losses abroad, without taking anything away from Rahane catching, other players have had good performances in catching. Coming to Rohit vs Pujara debate, Pujara failed in England and Australia, when given a full run. The commentators were pointing out issues with his grip, cross bat facing straight deliveries, in ability against the short ball. It was time for someone else to get chances, especially one on the wings waiting for so long and was given just one turn in England. So Rohit was picked up as the next one to try.

Pujara has solid technique &amp; temperament for tests. No doubt he is better than rohit. My playing 11 &amp; their order for SA test contest.. "Dhawan,Murli,Pujara,Virat,Rahane,Naman(wc),bhuvi (if 2 spinners),Ashwin,Mishra,Ishant,Yadav or Shami." Binny is useless so bhuvi will be as an allrounder. If India go with 5 bowlers then Naman is good choice for wicket keeper because he can play big innings.

When Pujara can get dropped and then asked to open, why hasn't Bangar, Shashri, Gavaskar and rest of Mumbai lobby has not taken easy about his loss of form despite several hundreds including overseas and double?

This debate is over. 5 current batsmen average over 40: Vijay, Dhawan, Pujara, Kohli and Rahane. They are your 5. Rohit is below 40 and Rahul is below 30 so they should be out unless a sixth batsman is wanted.

Rohit on the other hand started of very well against WI (again those runs count even if scored against an average WI attack), but has tapered rapidly beyond this matches. He has played a few good short innings but nothing which shapes a match, his 50 in the last innings was shaping of to be a good innings but then was cut short at the wrong time. Simply temperament is an issue. Rohit should be part of this team and play on but currently is he in he best 5-6 batsman India has? May be 6, but not in 5, Vijay, Dhawan, Pujara, Kohli and Rahane are India's top 5 batsman right now. The question the fans are asking is, how can Rohit then displace any of them currently? How can all experts openly talk about Rohit being given as many chances as possible at the expense of Pujara, or by moving around Rahane? Simply, basis performance yardsticks, this defies logic. At the end of the day runs count, there is nothing like beautiful or ugly runs. And Pujara scores them while Rohit is only promising.

Bangar is a coach of the team, and a coach is always going to support his players. A coach will never say publicly to someone his is currently coaching "yes, he is no good, drop him". His personal record is not relevant, so attacking Bangar averaging only 30 himself misses the mark. Good coaches or selectors need not be great players (and great players are mostly not good coaches). With that said, it is clear to most people who are neutral or a bit fair-minded is that Pujara should be preferred over Rohit. Pujara's record is better, his ability to play in tough conditions is better, and his ability to score big is better. Rohit should not be discarded permanently, but should have to wait for a spot to open up, when another batsman fails or India go with 6 batsmen.

As fans, i guess we are not the best judge of the potential of a batsman, obviously the greats must have seen something in Rohit Sharma which we have not been able to. What we can see though is statistics as well as quality of runs scored, situation in which the runs of scored. Pujara is heads and tail above Sharma on all of this presently. Statistically he is the best Indian batsman currently, important to note that runs scored at sub-continent also count, be it the flat roads. Pujara also just played one of the best innings seen in recent times against a spirited SL bowling to win the match for India. A quick comparison of the strike rates b/w two will show not much of a difference which is easily compensated by difference in average both have. Notwithstanding Pujara's performance in England, NZ and Australia, where he was average but then were others bar Vijay, Rahane and Kohli, Pujara has been the best Indian batsman on display in the last 3-4 years, TBC..

Give me 10 year old bowlers to bowl in my backyard . I will show all the class in this world to bangar, shastri, gavaskar etc. Hopefully , they will give me a 20 test match run in team.  Give Rohit Sharma run for even 50 tests , still he will fail to perform against decent bowling on good pitch. His odi batting lovers can check how many runs he had scored on decent odi pitches in SA(2013) , NZ(2014) . Scored centuries on Australian roads, failed to score runs in Sri Lanka when ball was doing a bit. Hopefully Steyn, morkel will end his test carrier this winter

Pujara has the highest Test average (12 more than Rohit) out of the current Indian batsmen.  To me, they both should play and Rohit should be given another series.  But India cannot continue to play Binny as an all-rounder.  Play Axar instead.  My playing XI would be Vijay, Rahul (wk), Pujara, Kohli, Rahane, Rohit, Ashwin, Mishra, Axar, Ishant, Yadav.  Rahul could be a Dravid like wicket keeper if groomed properly.  If they decide to play Ohja or Saha, then open with Rohit and the other keeper bats at no. 6.  No more Binny,  please Roger!!!

It is interesting that Bangar, with an average of under 30 from 12 tests (1 century) is promoting Nohit Sharma (averaging 38 with 2 centuries) over Pujara (averaging 50 with 7 centuries).  India should feel safe with the likes of Bangar making a case for Nohit over Pujara!  Great!!

Yes Mr. Bangar, we are hearing you. You can't obviously say that the team director wants Rohit in the side regardless of performance and if I have to keep my job I have to come out with all these funny lines. Pujara doesn't get singles! Do you remember your best test innings Mr. Bangar? The 68 you scored as test opener against England in England, in partnership with Rahul? Now, will you please keep quiet rather than come across as rather silly?

I sincerely pray that India's best ever batsman, the super duper talented, swashbuckling, six hitting,  the fearless, Rohit Sharna plays all matches against South Africa. Incase Shastri, Bangar and Kohli couldn't see it in Sri Lanka, let them at least see his failure against SA and get rid of him. If they still can't do that, god save cricket!  
PS: I would risk one series defeat in order to save the teams future from politics which glorifies ordinary players such as Rohit! Period!

Rohit is not gamechanger in the longer format that Pujara is. Pujara builds innings, Rohit contributes here and there. The ideal lineup for the indian is - Dhawan, Vijay, Pujara, Kohli, Rahane, Saha, and KL Rahul and Rohit as fringe batsman. Too much is changed around for Rohit at the cost of rahane and pujara.

What i said was the right solution...Play Rohit as a wicket-keeper batsman..Surely it is not difficult to keep..Just one hour practice before the match is enough to keep..We can see right-handed version of Gilchrist in Rohit sharma if it happens...

criticism is one thing but the way some people hates Rohit its like he is responsible for their personal loss.....firstly stop saying his career started in 2007 ...coz its November 2013....wen his test career started.....so if u r criticising him in test then don't talk about odi debut.....secondly lets come on green lively pitches which some Indians consider hardest to play ignoring the fact that best of teams struggle in subcontinent pitches  ...so wat was the pujaras average for the continuous 10 test matches which he played in nz,eng and Australia...rohith has better average than pujara during nz and Australia tour...and in England rohitplayed only one that.....thirdly this is team game nobody owns any position ....fourthly lets come to the the average then why despite all the odds Rohit was second highest scorer..during sl series if he's that bad played why this happened..... lastly please stop targeting one player...pujara is definitely world class player....so as rahane...leave this to team management.... because they definitely know better than us...they all played international cricket and represented India whether it's shastri kohli or bangar....its like quack teaches a surgeon how to operate....a mechanic  teaches engineer wat to do...so don't b couchexpert...just enjoy the Indian win over srilanka.

Those of you who comment should know that either Rohit nor Pujara or even Cricket Boards wouldn't pay any attention to what you comment here! No one cares whether you believe that Pujara is class or Rohit is technique or blah, blah! Take a deep breath and look calmly. Everyone is there in the eleven for a reason. When time comes, talent and potential will get the exposure,and in some cases it may be delayed, but it will still come out in the open. Be patient to wait and watch during this building phase of Indian Cricket. Stop criticizing and suggesting. Be an encourager, the world had plenty of critics already!

Anyways, just like crores of my fellow Indians, I will just sit back and enjoy the game whenever India plays! It doesn't matter who all are playing, you will still cheer for your country!

For test cricket, assuming that Pujara is not available, Rohit is not a bad choice. But with our 5 bowlers strategy, which is a perfect strategy to win test matches (specially abroad), the question comes who is temperamentally better  for test matches. The obvious answer is Pujara. It seems unfair to judge Rohit on the basis of a few (14) test matches he played, but he had definitely had a longer rope in short format before he established himself as a better player. Hence people will have more expectaions and  lesser patience with him as far as test cricket is concerned.

Out of these 870 runs there were 2 centuries at home against a weak opposition(WI). Actually forget the numbers. The problem is that he throws his wickets away. You ought to have someone at No. 3 who can grind it out when the going gets tough. He doesn't have that kind of patience. He wants to attack from ball 1(especially if the bowler is a spinner). That just doesn't work in test cricket!

why go easy on Rohit, why harsh on Pujara and what about giving opportunities to other talents? He has been playing international cricket for over 8 years now. Barring his double hundreds nothing is noteworthy in his long career. if his place in the team is still in doubt means its obvious that he isn't as talented as the selectors hype it. He debuted in odi's before Hashim Amla, Joe Root, Steven Smith, Virat Kohli, Kane Williamson. Their averages are better than his and are more consistent. Dear selectors please stop wasting lives of other youngsters in your quest to tap Rohit Sharma's 'in nets only' potential. Give opportunities to others, try them then discard them if not up to the mark. Like someone below said ODI cricket is not your learning school, its where you perform else will be disposed.

Obviously Critics have reasons.  Rohit hasn't done any favor to himself over his 14 tests career.  Those two centuries in India at the beginning of his career been the only highlights and since then he has brought his average down to around 37.  Even the last series again SL, he has gotten out completely irresponsibly-hooking the ball when the clear trap was set up for him or expansive drive outside off on moving ball.  The man is more like a kid who needs to grow up mentally and be a man..

Unfortunately, Bangar's views are not backed by the data. If you restrict the analysis to Tests played against the four strongest teams - Australia, South Africa, England and Sri Lanka - Pujara's average is above 50, whereas Rohit's is below 30. Both batsmen have played better at home than away, but Pujara's average outside India is also higher than Rohit's. I can name a number of batsmen who performed much better than Rohit in Tests but were summarily discarded.

Pujara has the highest Test average of 50 of all Indian batsmen &amp; even in his first 14 Tests, his average was 10 points higher than Rohit's. Pujara is banned from the short format whilst Rohit is NOT. Even during his lean period Pujara's average was higher than Rohit's. It is shameful that the best Indian bat is dropped unjustifiably for a Bombay player because he is supported by Bangar, Shastri, Gavaskar (all from Mumbai) &amp; Kohli. Pujara has better Technique, Temperament, skills than Rohit &amp; can play a long innings @#3 than any Test Batsmen in the World not just in India. Let us give credit where it is due &amp; not destroy the career of Pujara just to push your favourite! Unlike you Cricket fans are impartial!

Let Rohit play the entire SA series to have his revenge against that steyn.... Oh jeez this guy is a must in all formats.. If you cannot get Rohit into the test playing eleven ,just give him wicket-keeping practice and select him as a wicket keeper batsman(even though saha is a tough nut to crack) in Gilchrist mode...India will be a invincible team then.....

Rohit is slightly better than Yuvi and Raina when it comes to Test cricket. But thats about as much the positives get. Yes, he has technique, better than above two and could be decent fit in Test matches if India didnt have better option. The problem is like above two, he lacks in temperament. But rather than working on it, Indian management makes it sound like its his great inherent trait (aggro batsman, "I will hit the ball if I feel like") which need not be changed.As it is encouraged ROhit gets out after scoring meaningless 40-50s. Throwing away his wicket when situation dictates patience, is only met with "oh he is natural strokemaker". I dont see this attitude changing from management and hence the batsman would continue to be a avg bat against better Test bowling attacks. Yes he will get an odd 100 against WI on flat tracks but not much more. Cricinfo, kindly publish as I dont see any blasphemy in here! There are worse comments denigrating player which somehow get published.

Who is this comparing Rohit with Kallis! Complete shame. Kallis is one of the greatest cricketers to have ever played the game. Add all his runs plus 25 or 30 runs for each wicket he has got. You will know what Kallis has achieved. I always felt these Rohit fans cannot be stopped; they will keep going irrespective of his failures and the careers he is blocking. But some of the fans are going unbearable heights. Last week, someone brought Bradman's name and now Kallis. Have some sense while bringing in names of the legends.

On what basis did bangar became the batting coach. Pujara is a class player. Rohit is a good player,but in tests surely pujara is the best. He is so unfortunate that selectors doesnt back him,including the captain virat kholi. It is a shame that just because Rohit has to score runs ,they made rahane to bat at 3. Still after getting a man of the match pujara is an unlikely starter for first test vs SA. Feed bad for pujara. Pujara has the ability to score big runs and he doesnt satisfy himself just with a 50.

I suspect there are a lot of prejudiced opposition against Rohit sharma, and the feature writers are only attempting to get their attention and comments by writing articles such as this.  Ask anyone connected with the current team (not merely Bangar) and they would have got similar responses.

Mr Sanjay bangar, pujara had better numbers than what Rohit had during his first 13 matches. And don't say that the guy who got beaten by continues 13-14 balls in odi is a better strike rotater than pujara

Ok.. You want Rahane, who was at his best at no.5, to play at no.3. You want Pujara, who is a potential no.3 batsman, to open the innings. All these just to save one Rohit Sharma who doesn't perform anywhere in the top 4!! Among all these, it was Pujara and Rahane who scored centuries, that too match saving ones!! And still you back Rohit Sharma.. Welcome to team India selection!!!

Pray tel me what kind of strike rotator  your golden boy Rohit is. How about having a solid defense? That doesn't matter in Tests? Now it is all about hitting sixes? Banger you are lamer than I thought. No wonder your career with India was a non starter.

Something is clearly very wrong in Indian Management. They want to give ample of opportunity to NoHit on flat tracks so that he become a permanent member in test team. Y many concessions are given to Nohit? It wasn't long back when Rohit was criticized for not rotating strike. Even in onedays his strike-rate is only 82. Unlike other openers he play too slow in Initial phase. Y there is so much of love for this Mumbai guy? Pujara actually played very vital innings in England and Australia though he wasn't able to convert those starts in to big runs. No one in present Indian team except Rahane and may be vijay has ability to survive in testing condition. Very simple fact of runs and average is in increasing order as follows (Player/Match/Average) (#1)Lokesh Rahul /5/25 (#2)Rohit Sharma/14/37.82 (#3)Vijay/33/41.72 (#4)Rahane/18/43.64 (#5)Dhawan/15/44.53 (#6)Kohli/37/45.06 (#7)Pujara/28/49.28 .. Pujara is run machine &amp; figures clearly depicts politics and partiality against Pujara...

Four years ago in England Rohit Sharma was hit on his hand by Stuart Broad. When the doctor was examining his injury, he winced and yelled so loud that it was heard in the whole stadium.That I think is not the response of a fearless sportsman. Like someone said, he is a bit of a softie and loses concentration suddenly. For all his so called talent, he does not have the hunger or capacity to score big. Brian Lara was an artist as was Mark Waugh. But they scored big from the time of their introduction to the intenational level. Sharma can keep his lazy elegance for the limited over formats. India needs Pujara a Yorksireman in the Boycott category.I hope Shastri and Co do not make the blunder of preferring Rohit over him against the Proteas come October particularly when they intend playing with only five batsmen.

I think they are keeping Rohit in team because India will play most of its test in subcontinent where he can make runs too quick compared to Pujara .....BT selectors must not forget ..India has one of the most attacking player in test in subcontinent ....SHIKHAR DHAWAN...so we don't need all attackers in our side....even Rahane can score runs quick in subcontinent... my team fr 1st test against south Africa will b.......
S DHAWAN....M VIJAY/KL RAHUL....C PUJARA....V KOHLI....A RAHANE...N OJHA....R ASHWIN...R JADEJA....A MISHRA...B KUMAR...UT YADAV/M SHAMMI...***We need jadeja fr tests in subcontinent ...three seamers won't hurt SA....Shammi must come back quickly and Harbhajan should be given a series with West Indies and take retirement ...he is useless nw and shud retire as legend...

It seems that all the faults lie with Cheteshwar Pujara, no matter how much he scores. It seems that all the virtues lie with Rohit Sharma, no matter how less he scores. Rohit Sharma's test average after the 1st 2 tests was 288,made against the weak West Indian bowling attack. His test average after 14 tests is 37.82. Which player has such an enormous dip in average in a span of 12 tests? Meanwhile Pujara's average in 28 tests is nearly 50. How many players currently playing has that average? What is the fault of Pujara?

Well well looks like NoHit sharma will never be dropped from test matches. Pls india follow this advice 1. Kick sanjay bangar, ravi shasthri out of team management 2. Have a head coach like Warne or punter 3. Remove nohit sharma from all the format he is just a flat track bully.

Agree. Give Rohit some time before coming to conclusion. We can't say enough about a batsman before he plays atleast 30-35 tests and Rohit has played less than 15 Tests. In ODIs he is more than what others achieved during their time. As I pointed out before that he has attacking kind of mindset like Sehwag who used to play all three formats in same fashion. Rohit is just in dilemma and trying to adapt to different formats which he actually need not to. No matter what format you are in if you are an attacking player than forget about playing defensively first. Just play your strokes and get runs. It is better to get out playing stroke rather than defending a ball that is always there to be hit because of your mindset. I played cricket in my life with just one mindset and it was attack from first ball and keep on finding gaps and try to get run of every single ball you face.

He reminds me of Ravi Bopara.  After Essex signed him on at age 17, and then going on to be selected for the English under-19 side, one word that was constantly attached to him was "potential".  Yet Bopara could never solidify himself in the English team on the back of his performances.  Rohit is pretty much in the same boat.  He's beautiful to watch when he's on song, and there's no doubt he has talent and potential, but how many chances are too many to convert that potential into something real for the team?

@LANCIA71, your assessment of Rohit and your ability to compare him with Hooper tells me that you are a good follower of the game. Yes, Rohit more like Inzamam seem to have the gift of playing the ball as late as one could. Many years have gone by since Rohit came in to international scene. Him and his backers hide behind those few huge innings he has played thus far (against weaker opponents though). It isn't enough. We can't sacrifice other available talent in order to make Rohit work. We all want our investment to bear fruits, but there is a time you want to exit out of one when you know it isn't working. We are more or less past that time on Rohit, it is about time we put en end to this joke.

@RomanticStud .. Jacques Henry Kallis started as a 20 year old in the test team and would have played 13 tests before turning 22. Our Bradman is 28 now.

@RAJESH_INDIA_1990	 .. Seriously man 3 centuries for Rohit vs SA !! Do you really think Steyn against whom he looked so petrified and couldn't even get bat to ball will allow him that ? No Indian player has ever got 3 hundreds against SA in a test series. Is he the best Indian batsman of all time ? Yes 1 day he will as he is 'Perennially potential star' but that day will never actually come.

Kunakrish : I dont know if you follow cricket but if you ask anybody they would say that rohit would be anytime in the odi side .... scored two double centuries in the format.... scored 264 on his own which sometimes team find difficult to score..... he is not performing in test matches agreed so that cannot be taken against him to be left out of odi side .....and in fact he should be in a squad as well but should not walk in team in place of pujara ....I am sure that he will surely make improvement in his game and do well in test matches as well...

A batsman must have some qualities to be successful at the highest level. I list some of these which to my mind areabsolutely necessary. Firstly a sound technique. I do not mean like Gavaskar or Manjrekar. That may not be possible. At the same time, he should have the flexibility to adapt when necessary. What is more is that if he fails despite a sound technique, he should have the humility and intelligence to consider changes. Secondly he must have the hunger for big scores and the patience to score these in the team's cause. He just cannot afford to have a lapse of concentration at the international level where the tussle between batsman and bowler is an ongoing one. Rohit Sharma's biggest problem is his loss of awareness of the present. If he thinks a ball has to be hit in a way he goes ahead unmindful of the team cause. He can overcome that if he is made conscious of it. The other thing is a batsman should be fearless of getting hit. He should also have the humility to learn.

I am a sri Lankan and no expert in batting but I think Rohit is more gifted and talented than Pujara. Rohit seems to have a lot of time to play his strokes. May be Shastri and Virat are thinking there is potential in the man and continuing with him. But have to say Rohit has a habit of finding ways to get out when set. May be another Carl Hooper�never reached his potential despite loads of talent!

If Shastri, Kohli &amp; co. insist to play 5 bowlers (Binny/Bhuvi being 5th), WHO SITS OUT ?

After a magnificent match-winning hundred, will they still drop Pujara ?

Oh wait, let's drop Rahane instead...it's perfectly good option. Afterall Rohit is our new #5. Let's give him few lightyears long rope.

Oh wait, let's drop Rahane instead...it's perfectly good option. Afterall Rohit is our new #5. Let's give him few lightyears long rope.
</p>, <p>
<p>
Playing pujara at 3 will save the team from any early dismals and rahul dravid itself has back rahane at 5. rohit should play only at 6 and can score quickly with wicketkeeper and tailenders as he has no patience to survive new ball. Take a call between rohit or bowling allrounder instead of pujara.

Jacques Henry Kallis had a batting average of just 25.52 at the end of 13 tests. His bowling average was a shabby 37. Rohit Sharma has a batting average of 37.8
</p>
<p>
Andrew David Searle Look at the stats of Jacques Henry Kallis after 13 Test matches, You would also have a few harsh views, but look at his career stats at what they were at the end of it. Sharma needs to be given opportunity to become a better player in the test squad

They way Bangar is praising RG sharma is not convincing not even hell for one percentage. he don't deserve to play test matches, he always thorough his wicket. there is nothing wrong if cheteshwar pujara take over his place. what wrong with it cheteshwar pujara didn't done anything wrong particularly in test matches. he is far better player in test compare to Rohit Sharma. those shitty heads should review the average of RG Sharma in ODI's his home average 50 above but his overseas average not even above 20. let him play ranjhi's the way he wants to play. there are a lot of young talent warming bench and waiting for their chance. this is completely insane to give RG Sharma one more chance.

"After those five opportunities, we felt that moving him down the order would benefit the team more. And it also made sure that he got some time because he also had put a lot of pressure on himself to perform". 
Well Mr. Bangar...It was more for the benefit of Rohit...  You were making sure that sure  Rohit got some time... But at what cost... exposing the set and dependable rahane at no. 3...

I used to suspect, but now its becoming more and more clear that kohli fears Pujara in tests.... After warming the bench for so long and even then winning the test match single handedly, they think he does not deserve the place and Rohit does... No matter what he does, it seems, he will always be the 2nd choice... He, rahane and vijay are  the best test batsmen that India had post SRT, laxman dravid and ganguly era...
Please dont make pujara the sacrificial goat.. He is too good a batsman in comparision to  the others...

I had great respect for the utility value of Sanjay Bangar, seaming allrounder (same as the current day Stuart Binny), but his arguments are botched up, though I have nothing against Rohit. My objection is only for what he says "Pujara was struggling"! When, Sanjay? Its extremely unfair for a team official to talk like this. I took up the challenge of comparing the first 13 test matches of a few recent n great players and have revealing stats: Pujara stands tall with 1180 runs, 4 centuries (including 2 double tons) and an astonishing average of 65.55. The next nearest is Dravid (947 runs at 49.84), Rahane (1026 runs at 44.6), Ganguly (768 at 40.42). and the guys below Rohit (794 at 37.80) are our current captain Kohli (788 at 35.81) and the great man, the Bharat Ratna Tendulkar (666 at 35.05)! Perhaps these two guys Bangar wants Rohit to be compared to, when he says "if his critics can go back and compare the first 13 Test matches of any other cricketer who has played for a while.."!

I think test cricket is all about temperament... Fed up of listening to aggressive cricket.. That is what led us t downfall in first test... We needed pujara innings in first test... There is no point tht rohit gets starts n throws away... He doesn't deserve a place in side at t cost of pujara... It's a pity tht pujara sits out... Making a scapegoat of him... Shame on virat shastri n management.... Aggressive cricket. My balls

Bangar in his interview sneaks through a point on behalf of Rohit Sharma that he averages 40 while the actual average is 37. By the same extrapolation, Pujara's average is 50 since his actual average is 47. Now, is Bangar trying to tell that he will choose Rohit who averages 40 in fewer tests over Pujara who averages 50 over more tests at No.3? Seriously Bangar? you must be kidding and fooling big time. This is an absolutely unfair selection matter which clearly has some vested interests behind it. The sponsorship money in the name of Rohit Sharma must be the thing. Otherwise why on earth would Shastri, Gavaskar, selectors go on backing some Rohit Sharma. It is clearly evident that Pujara has better runs, hundreds, average, and temperament than Rohit all in factual quantity and quality. Only difference is Rohit has more commercial endorsements and sponsorship money than Pujara. This, my dear folks, is the real buying power in Indian team.

@SHAYKUMAR This kind of cavalier mindset is the reason why indian test team is so impotent. Like Gavasker had said in Dhoni times (when Sir Jadega were given too many chances and Dhoni proudly defended saying team is still "learning") that International Test Cricket is not a bloody learning school.
Look at Australia for instance, they choose based on the merit of performance (regardless of age). Although they didn't succeed this time in Ashes, but at least they're not stubborn like Indian so called coaches. They admit their mistake for wrong selections instead of justifying it with bull crap.
And whoever this new generation T20 bred ppl (who know little about test cricket) have been repeatedly applauding and comparing Mr.Talented Rohit Sharma's 2 double centuries in 50 ovs format surely know so little, only real test fan would know how tough (and different ball game) is the test cricket which needs real BALLS to stand there up in the middle in testing conditions against quality bowling

I think bangar doesnt have any option, coz of shastri and Kohli. As he cannot take a call due to the majority, so he's doing the last option he has got, i.e. backing the player and showing confidence in him. Sympathies..

@KUNAKRISH If your whole purpose is to hate someone, then nobody can help you out...In fact, his avg in ODI in 2011 is also more than 50 but he had a dreadful year in 2012....I hope you know we are talking about ODI not Test matches....I'm damn sure that more than 75% of the people here would want Rohit in ODI team considering his performance in the last 5 years!! BTW, he is the x-factor in the ODI team &amp; easily the most difficult batsman to bowl in the last 10-15overs!!

I am bit amused to see that guys are going after rohit. Just a year before we all were criticizing dhoni for preferring ishant, now no one talk about that. We all are very passionate but one thing we should not forget that decision makers are also have some brain. They may be able to see we are'nt. Ishant is another example.

How does it matter? Whether critics are harsh or not, whether people like him or not doesn't matter. He will play in either case. So, Mr. Bangar along with Mr. Shastri, don't keep telling us about Rohit and his flair, potential etc. We are getting used to the fact that Rohit will play till he retires. So no need to justify his selection.

Rohit is being increasingly criticized solely due to the bias statements coming in support of him from the Team Management. If he had been treated at par with other players no one would have had any issues. But, instead they are giving lame excuses, and cutting and chopping the team to somehow include him. The only person who is going to suffer from this Team Management backing is Rohit himself, because the pressure will keep mounting on him each time he steps on the field, and the viewers will go on vilifying him!

Honestly Rohit's body language doesn't inspire any confidence.One gets a feeling that  he's been forcefully made to play Test cricket!!No doubt he's a talented cricketer but he's not putting enough runs on the board to prove the talent.Too many chances have been wasted on him when the likes of Pujara have been made to cool their heels. The guys an excellent ODI player but Test cricket?It's a big NO,NO please!!

@UNBIASED-VIEWS I don't think so, even bangladesh will think twice to have him in the side, in the first place he wouldn't be playing if other country he would be dropped in 2nd year in this long waiting volcano which can burst at any time of 8 years.

Even at my critics against rohit, I don't have any doubt on his abilities.  He is definitely a big hitter and can play blinder of innings.  But he cannot accommodate No. 3 batsman in test and even during his so called test innings where he scored he could not give the viewers the feeling of comfort at times he used to poke on off side deliveries and for his luck that do not cost him his wicket.  Jadeja had played during his knocks a vital part in Lord's victory by way of a slashing innings, but you cannot account it as a test innings especially for one who is accommodate in the playing XI as a pure batsman.  Actually I don't know what pujara did that much worst in his career.  It is right he failed during england tour, but he definitely had played much deliveries than even rohit played.   Test innings should be counted not for the runs scored but the way it scored and the patience and temperament shown

Either we are dumb or Indian coach ! Rohit sharma is best among in ODI and T20 but not at test level.. He is too lazy to play test and his temperament also not good.. I am huge Rohit fan but do not want him to play ahead of pujara in any case... If you read any comments any polls any technical adviser view every one has one point Rohit is not suitable for tests and as compare to Cheteswar Pujara for sure not at all !! Please stop giving him a run ahead of Pujara.... and when you want specialized  5 batsman + 1 wicket keeper batsman then you can bet on Rohit against trustworthy Pujara anytime !!

Again, its all nice to talk the talk of playing "an aggresive brand of cricket" &amp; a 5-bowler strategy....but what is Stuart Binny??? He is a bits and pieces player whose batting nor bowling is of test match standard! India are better off with 6 batsmen the keeper and 4 quality bowlers. If u really need an allrounder then pick a genuine one! Or a quality batsman who can offer control with the bowl. Raina for all his failures may be a better option all-round than Binny! Even Irfan Pathan &amp; Rishi Dhawan

I honestly dont understand how we can complain about Rohit. He has 2 double centuries in one day cricket its only a matter of time before he proves critics wrong in test cricket too. Honestly out of all our batsmen he has the most potential, I think we need to be patient on not just him but all our players. We are too quick to criticise and kick a player out of the team each player under 30 years needs to be given more time. Though I am very excited about this new look India I dont expect us to win every series I feel we will have lows but eventually we will learn how to overcome! Good luck Kohli and India!

Why so many Rohit haters are there to critisize him all the time?.. This Guy is a must in all formats.. He will take us to that No.1 position in tests by replying with his bat..For god's sake he already had two double hundreds in ODI's.... No wonder he is called as 'Hitman'......... He will score atleast 3 centuries this SA series coming October..Just wait and watch friends..

The problem that most of us have, is the unfathomable support that is being given to Rohit Sharma at the cost of Pujara. To begin with, he was slated into the side against Bangladesh, saying that he had performed well in Australia and hence, was preferred over Pujara, it was conveniently forgotten that Pujara had scored more runs than him, even in Australia. Secondly, why is the balance of side being disturbed in the name of giving stability to the team, for e.g. Hard working Rahane has been given yet another test to play at no. 3, when he was well-settled at no. 5, Pujara was our best man at 3, yet no one is ready to acknowledge that. I am not even doubting the talent of Rohit Sharma, he will no doubt perform at some point of time, and will do well in the Indian conditions, where he is accustomed to do well. 
My problem is when India goes abroad again , (where Sharma's ODI record also doesn't stand out) do they want a settled middle order or a 30 year old still trying to find his way?

Well said Bangar. Even, Sir Jadeja is also very good test cricketer. Problem is the rule of test cricket. BCCI should consider changing it to give Rohit and Jadeja more chances. They shouldn't be given out  until they are ruled out 5 times at least.

is he kidding really?  In test matches especially for a No. 3 player patience is the key not the rotation of strikes, at least for first innings.  India's batting coach is trying to establish a 'so called' deficiency for a reasonably good test batsman of India to spoil his career.  I really pity him as he is not at all a good person either at the time he represented India, or this time when he is named as batting coach.  Actually he is supporting the foolishness of management only for his position in the team.  He conveniently ignores the statistics of a batsman like pujara.  The alleged so called tough times also he had better average than the other members of the team other than Kohli &amp; Vijay.

I really pity him as he is not at all a good person either at the time he represented India, or this time when he is named as batting coach.  Actually he is supporting the foolishness of management only for his position in the team.  He conveniently ignores the statistics of a batsman like pujara.  The alleged so called tough times also he had better average than the other members of the team other than Kohli &amp; Vijay.

Sure Mr.Bangar, ask him to play first class and club games which won't be telecasted and hence the critics won't have any chance to say anything against him. Come on, he is not working on an endlessly improving software wherein your knowledge of the older version hardly matters after a few years. Since the day he started playing cricket, he would have taken a bat and hit the ball, I doubt if he is using a broom to bat unlike other batsmen. He seems to have a problem with applying his talent. Please work on that rather than pacifying the critics.

It is important o play Pujara, regardless of whether Rohit plays or not. Rohit might do well in the home series against South Africa and then the same selectors would say "see, we told you that Rohit is special." and yet again give him an extended run. As per kohli, the idea is to go with a  6+5 combination. Now the 6 batsmen would be Vijay, Dhawan/Rahul, Pujara, Kohli, Rahane, Rohit. I do not see a problem with that.

Ideally, Rohit should be in the squad as a back up for no. 4 and 5, and in the team when India plays 6 batsmen (at no. 6), but after seeing the false hype of the team management about Rohit, I believe it is time for the selectors to drop him from the squad altogether. Otherwise either Pujara or Rahane may have to sit out to accommodate the most talented Rohit .

Indeed, I believe the very harsh critcs on Rohit is a bit unfair. Still, I am convinced, in test cricket he is below the level of Vijay, Dhawan, Pujara, Kohli and Rahane He should play only if one of the above is injed or when six batsmen strategy is followed.

Sanjay Bangar has opined to compare stats of any Indian batsman in his first 13 tests with that of Rohit Sharma...if you compare Pujara's stats with him then automatically Pujara shud be picked in the playing XI...also if Pujara is having a tough time currently then so is rohit sharma...infact rohit sharma has been having a tough time since his debut so again Pujara must be preferred over Rohit Sharma any day for India

Bangar asking the critics to take it easy about Rohit. Hope he and his trigger (Shastri, Gavaskar, etc) understand that it is not a movie to let out Salman Khan style movie dialogues. For God's sake forget Rohit, people are talking about a precious place in the Indian team. I do not understand why so many from the back end management are backing Rohit Sharma. Why is not the case for Pujara? Was Pujara similarly and vocally supported when he was out of form? Why special treatment to Rohit alone is the question? Bangar in his 'take it easy' style silently extrapolates Rohit's average from 37 to 40s to build perceptions. By Bangar's own extrapolation, Pujara average can be corrected from 47 to 50. So is Bangar trying to tell that he will choose Rohit who averages 40 at random batting position over  Pujara who averages 50 at no.3? Seriously Bangar, you must be kidding and fooling big time.

Can at least one Indian fan explain to me what exactly the management is trying to make out of Rohit? He's not better than Rahane or Pujara, let alone talented than either of them since the word "talented" is always thrown all over the place whenever he's in discussion. Come November when we tour India, I wouldn't mind Sharma over Pujara, at least Steyn, Morkel and Philander won't have to work hard enough to remove him. If he gets in then he'll probably have a brain-fade somewhere between 30-50.

The selectors are not going to drop Rohit however badly he performs . The policy appears to be to give chance to Rohit till he succeeds . In the case of Pujara , the polcy is to give Chance only when he succeeds . I can't help feeling that the selectors are treating Pujara as badly as they treated Laxman . When the team decides to go with 5 batsmen , everyone of the chosen 5 should play responsibly . In order to allow Rohit to succeed , the team is even prepared to sacrifice Rahane at 4 ,which is very bad . Bangar can go along with the band wagon to support Rohot's cause but he has no business to ask the critics to join him .

Rohit Sharma has proved again and again that he is just an IPL player...nothing more then that.
And stupid comments from Shastri / Kohli / Bangar...  ruining the careers of other players (Pujara / Rahane / Rahul +++) just to prove a point.

there is no doubt that rohit Sharma has lot of talent but that is not seen on the ground consistently and hence he needs to prove himself there ..... currently with 5 batsman rohit does not deserve a place in the 11 ..... incase one of the opener is injured I would opt for rohit Sharma over rahul and make pujara open the inngs .... currently rohit should be in waiting and should be brought it only if any of the batsman is teribly out of form or injured ....

The logic of giving more games to Rohit is so warped. Pujara had to sit out after a few bad games, now that he has regained his form he should be slotted back immediately. After all, the selectors have invested time and effort in Pujara's development and they should get back return on their investment. Anyway, at the same stage Pujara had better numbers than Rohit. His two centuries were against a weakened West Indies side. I am sure Mr. Bangar quality of opposition too matters.

Who exactly are Rohit's critics? Surely not Gavaskar, Shastri, Kholi etc?  Perhaps Mr. Bangar meant to say that Pujara's critics - of which there are many, and a lot of those are influential people - should go easy on him? 
</p>
<p>
Apart from us long suffering fans - and of course Rohit is not the sole cause of despair re team India - I have heard only praise for this fellow. Flair, talent, promise...in other words: just cross your fingers and hope for the best! And in the meantime, don't worry about the batting order, or about proven performers warming the bench against reason (not just Pujara, think about why Binny gets games ahead of Bhuvi...). 
</p>
<p>
The problem with all these statements and actions is that most genuine and knowledgeable cricket fans know what we see and aren't easily fooled. We were not born yesterday!
</p>
<p>
In a broader context, I find the following to be highly disconcerting, "With the BCCI still not sure about the structure of the support staff..." Why aren't they sure? Why?

I dont even remember a single good innings form this flop Bangar during his time. He was not even dit to be a bits and pieces street cricketer and somehow got into the team. Now this flop is supporting another flop which is unfortunate. Nohit Sharma is a useless cricketer accept it.

After their (Shastri, Kohli &amp; Bangara) horrible decision to play Rohit at no.3 which backfired completely, the trio is trying to cover it up with some foolish statements. Bangara talks about Pujara's inability to do strike rotation in the begining. No Indian batsman in this current line up can do the strike rotation. Leave alone Pujara. That's why, Rohit goes for aerial shots, in the begining and has got out many times. Puajara has ideal temperment for no. 3 and he should take that place. Rohit will be no. 6 if India plays 6 batsmen and when India plays 5 batsmen, Rohit should warm the bench.., in test cricket.

Wow...Bangar...the guy is sinking to new levels of stupidity spewing a bunch of nonsense..."Rohit brings flair at No. 3"...yeah, we know how that went. Leave Pujara alone...frankly the only way to do this right for India is to kick out Ravi Shastri and bungling Bangar (why is he even a batting coach?)

Pathetic at it's best. In both innings of the third test, Rohit failed at the crucial time. If not for Ashwin, second innings lead would not have crossed 350. For God Sake, Understand that some players are not test material. Bevan, Yuvraj, Klusener were extra-ordinary one day players but pathetic in test. The same goes to Rohit as well. In fact, he isn't an extra-ordinary odi batsman as well. If not Pujara, at least find some other players who have the temperament to play five day matches. Badri, Manoj Tiwari, even Gambhir to name a few. But Rohit would be found wanting against SA and only then these fan base would accept him as a failure.

rohit sharma should consider himself very lucky because despite so many failures selectors decided to continue with him.he looked much better in the last two test matches against srilanka.he definitely has some serious technical issues with his against the pacers so I hope he utilitieses the break before the home series against the proteus and rectifies his technical errors.i think he looks better when he attacks the opposition bowling and that's the best way to do when you just keep poking deliveries outside of the off stump.at times offense is the best option against defense.

it's not how many test matches Mr Rohit Sharma Played.but question is about his temperament and how he got out in every innings.he just threw his wicket away every second inning he plays.yes he had great talent but that does not mean anything if does not perform for India,there are number of people are in queue for getting one chance to prove himself and Mr Sharma getting so many chances without performing.

Another classical case of a coach backing up the captain's decision because he has no other option. The average 40 is a good number, agreed. But how many knocks came under testing conditions. Many players would not have an average of 40 in first 14 tests. But they wouldnt have also played International cricket for 7 years before starting to play tests. These are days when fans are being used to such nonsense talks and everyone knows for sure that people like Rohit always get to play games irrespective of performances. We wont be surprised even if Pujara is dropped the next game to make way for Hitman.

Rohit Sharma will let his mouth do the taking while Pujara will let his bat do the talking...that the difference between these players

Cool Mr Bangar.... I wanna ask you a few questions
(Sanjay Bangar, Bharat Arun and R Sridhar are assistant coaches of the current Indian team)
</p>
<p>
Why Mr Bangar is giving so many interviews...During the Sri Lanka tour he has given around 7-8 interviews.. first he defended Rohit Sharma's failure in the warm up matches saying he is a class player and brings flair to the number 3 position and he should bat at 3....then after the flop show from Rohit he said we have full faith in his abilities.....before the 2nd test he did a U - turn and said the India batsmen should be ready to bat any position (for saving only one player the rest have to sacrifice).....then after the 2nd test win he hailed the batsman for being flexible....then one more interview explaining wicket keeper Saha's role and the lower order batsman...then after the 3rd test win...he went on praising Capt Kholi and now today again...he has started again....

<p>
Are these guys seeing something else in Rohit that we arent?

If you are wrong , admit it. Lehmann admitted they were wrong in bringing Shaun March for the 4th test. Why cant you guys admit you were wrong in not picking Pujara

Bangar - For heaven sake please don't protect Nohit Sharma . Nohit Sharma is a pure "WASTE OF SPACE" given the contributions (Sparring a ODI double hundred and World cup century) .  India is not dearth of talent to give him such a long rope . Please invest on Rahane, Pujara and Rahul or any other player (Manoj Tiwary, Naman Ohja , Jadhav) who will be yielding good returns in short span rather banking on such a hopeless player (Nohit Sharma). All commentators should be blamed for creating a hype over him.  Nohit Sharma needs to expelled immediately from all forms of game.

As a player Bangar missed out marginally- had his batting been a bit more consistent or had his bowling been a bit more quicker, he would have played many more international matches. But he has been excellent as a coach and in support in the limited opportunities he has got. He gets to see players at close quarters, understands the game, and I would give a lot of weight to his perceptions. I hope he enables all the current guys in the Indian team including Pujara and Sharma to improve their game.

if you are putting him at no.5 then why Pujara suffers..it should be rahane..but then why he should be removed. He is fantastic at no.5..Basically, they have taken a contract to include rohit sharma in playing XI..Pujara at 3 and rahane at 5 gives India its best chances..scores of 39 and 53 are not for no 3 in tests..how the hell is he defending him??

Who's paying these guys to talk up Rohit? Pujara just scored an insane match-winning century, yet here we are reading this drivel about Rohit being the preferred option.

I think this is a classical case of a mediocre coach trying to justify his wrong decisions by backing a repetitive looser . What Bangar forgot to mention was that the two centuries Rohit has have come against a very poor West Indies test attack  . And after that till now , he has been a complete failure . Compare that to Rahane who has a century in almost all overseas tours ( not to mention the one which won us the only test victory out of the sub continent in the last four years) and has no one from the BCCI to back him . I wonder if Rahane would have been still in the team had he also performed similar to Rohit  ??
</p>
<p>
The reason Rohit was moved down the order was because of his inability to play the new ball .. else he would have had less than 100 runs in the whole series and then the selectors would have dropped him for sure . I didn't knew that the team management will eat their own words after creating so much hype about Rohit being a match winning number 3!! Losers saving another!!

@gdalvi: The most important point you fail to make however while bringing up SRT's first few Test stats is that all his first few Tests were away against real quality opposition (how about this for a sample: Imran, Wasim, Waqar, Hadlee, McDermott, Hughes - England was the only team with a somewhat weaker attack but a handful in seaming conditions with Lewis, Fraser, Malcolm), and don't forget the fact that he was not even 20 years old! He hadn't even played Ranji cricket yet, for crying out loud! He didn't have enough FC experience yet. Those days starting out with an average in the mid 30s was pretty decent (esp when he didn't have much better competition in the Indian side itself), because the conditions, quality of bowling, and wickets were such. So comparing SRT's early stats to someone like Rohit, a product of the 2000s makes no sense.

If team India has Rohit in the 11, it should be at 5 / 6.  If the top 3 do their job well, Rohit will come in around the 60th over with the bowlers a shade tired &amp; the scoreboard reading 3 - 190.  Best time for someone like him to take the game away from the opposition.  If the top 3 do an average job, he will still come in around the 40th over at 3 - 120, settle in a bit &amp; then have a fair chance to take charge.
If the top 5 absolutely screw up, Rohit's see ball hit ball approach gives India the best chance to come back into the game.  At 3 for 15 of 10 overs, if you have a plodder coming in and even consuming 30 overs, 3 - 60 off 40 overs and the opposition 4th &amp; 5th bowlers settled into a rhythm is not good news for India.  In fact, the will not score approach of the Indian batsmen will allow the strike bowlers to take a good rest &amp; come back fresh.  Rohit hitting the ball &amp; India 3 - 140 off 50 overs....opposition is thinking.

@SAMROY: You are right ON. Rohit Sharma only fits in the XI if India plays with a 6th bat. He cannot be included at the expense of Pujara or Rahane. Many Fans are claiming that Rohit had played just 14 tests &amp; it is difficult to assess on such limited Exposure. Pujara's average after 14 Tests was in 60's! 202 runs in 6 innings(@ 34 average) is not  big deal! Pujara has averaged 145 in this series! Even in 3rd Test Ashwin coming at #9 scored 58 in partnership with Mishra, Yadav &amp; Ishant! Binny got 49. So every lower order bat contributed, not just Rohit's 50. Pitch was not seaming as much on Day 4.

IMO Rohit Sharma will never be a great batsman or a world class test batsman. This guy has the same problems which both Yuvraj and Raina have had. When the ball swings or seams around he can't put bat to ball. Which echos lack of proper defensive technique. Plus when the ball is spinning big again he bats like a tailender.  Yes, Rohit is somewhat better than Raina in the fact that he doesn't have a short ball weakness but the aforementioned weaknesses are good enough to conclude that he will never be a world class test batsman. And on top of that often he loses patience and throws his wicket away. So a No. 6 batsman whenever team needs one definitely not in top 5. I think in the long run somebody else (like Sarfraz Khan or Karun Nair) will replace him.

This shows that now we are praising even a 50 by an Indian batsman. These guys are supposed to score hundreds, we are talking about test matches. Have we forgotten Dravid, Sachin, Gavaskar, Vishwanath and so many others. We are also talking about SL bowlers not AUS, ENG, SA or NZ. Pujara's Inning set the tone for this test match because IND could have found themselves in a lot of trouble and lost the match. It is a match winning inning. Score of  50 here and there is expected of all batters even lower down the order. Rohit is a good batsman but he needs to learn to control his natural instinct to hit the ball in the air, need to concentrate, can't keep playing shots and get away with it in a test match. In an Interview he says he will keep playing his shots, well he will keep getting those scores of 30 to 60 which is not good enough for a test batsman.

But then get ready for some comments like "Virat first made Rohit play at #3 he failed then #5 ,Pujara made much better while opening , so again to accommodate Rohit, Virat sacrificed his 5 bowlers theory!!"  ,... Moral : To satisfy all of the people in this world is impossible.

How is it that there is no article published about the guy who carried his bat through in the first innings scoring almost 150 on this pitch ?? And here is another guy who threw his wicket just after scoring 50 and we have praises being showered on him .. I think Ashwin played as well as any one else ...  To me it seems the talent that never materialised in test cricket has some fans in the media too !!

Oh please, he was moved to no 5 to save him from being dropped as he was an embarrassment as one down. Poor Pujara, he got an unbeaten hundred after opening the innings, and Rohit gets the credit for being flexible.

Oh please, he was moved to no 5 to save him from being dropped as he was an embarrassment as one down. Poor Pujara, he got an unbeaten hundred after opening the innings, and Rohit gets the credit for being flexible.

rohit played a decent knock yesterday coming in at 7/3 .  But when he threw his wicket away after making a 50 it shows his temperament issues.  We need to recognize that Pujara is the ideal no:3 and Rahane is head and shoulders better than Rohit at 5.  There are 5 spots.  Virat picks himself at 4.  Openers first preference Dhawan and Vijay.  If Rahul can play the role of wicketkeeper he can be at 6.  If India play 5 bowlers Rohit has to sit out and so will Rahul.  If India play 6 batsmen Rohit gets to play at 6.

Lol! Ashiwn scored 58, Binny 49, Mishra 38 and Ojha 35. But this guy gets the credit for holding the innings together. Then what was Pujara doing in the first innings? But that's the advantage of being Rohit, score a 50 and you have articles praising a Bradmanesque performance...

Few months back Rohit Sharma claimed that opening spot should be reserver for him. He asked why no one questioned Sachin whenever he returned from an injury but why question him. Now he wants to bat at number 5 and he says nowhere it is written that batting positions are reserved for any batsman. Nothing needed to say of Rohit anymore. Clearly no logic in Indian Cricket any more.

Being Rohit is the toughest thing now. The so called 'biased' media and fans (haters) are trying to put too much pressure on him to ruin his career. But kudos to him for overcoming all these stupid pressure with flying colors. With no support from media and fans every innings look like his last innings. But have to admit this guys courage. With ball moving on a dark evening on a difficult pitch and test spot his hanging on the smallest of the thread , it will require a courage of a lion to dance down the track and hit Herath for a six. Yes a spinner is a lesser threat on this pitch but still one has to give credit to him. I have seen only Virender Sehwag having such kind of uncluttered mindset in such adverse situation. On the fourth morning he tried his best to curb the new ball with a range of courageous strokeplay to put India back into game with a 50. But in media the headline  was 'Rohit falters when it matters most' , such a joke !!

Sharda Ugra, you were so hell bent on criticising India for allowing Sri lankan lower order to score few more runs that what was needed. Now Sri lanka allowerd India to get away from 7/3 to a massive lead, but nothing on that, And that's why it is difficult to read your articles.

@AmirSydney Rohit came in at 7/3 with a lead less than 120 and contributed to 2 50 partnerships taking the team to safety and the only batsmen in the top 7 to score a 50. some people would consider that pretty good even if not extra-ordinary. remember first test where we folded for 100 chasing 170? he prevented us folding for 100 again.

@SPORTOFPAIN - that his is job!  Scoring individual 50s (to guarantee the next game) is not the same as scoring a 100 for the team.  He has no application/focus in Tests.  ODI's (on flat tracks) he's a shoe-in!  Tests need a different mindset and a hunger to "just hang around until batting gets easier".  With Rohit if the conditions don't suit from the first ball, he has no application to tough it out.  Complete waste of space in the this format.

@SPORTOFPAIN: Well said, lot of fans doesn't understand how difficult it is to play when you are under the gun (pressure) like Rohit. He is talented but I agree with some of the folks that Pujara is main contender but again whatever management and captain thinks better for a match. 
Everybody talked about Binny as well but he became handy even though it was a scratchy innings with the bat and of course did a good job with the ball being secured a place as allrounder. Remember, unfortunately we did't have any allrounders rather ready to take that spot. Long ago used to Irfan but where is he now. Other 2 Rishi &amp; Shankar I guess need to play more list A games to get more exposure. Only missing part I think is Rohit can bowl offspin so Team India need to focus on that part to groom him as a spin allrounder. I remembered cricinfo mentioned him as allrounder during begining of his career but Dhoni converted him as batsman. I respect everyone opinion but give him break &amp; let him focus on game

This whole issue of Rohit being included in the team is because of the five bowlers policy adapted by Kohli. Rohit is being criticized for no fault of his. However, if you re playing only five batsmen, preferring Rohit over Pujara makes no sense. This is where, people are turning against Rohit, when in reality he has no control over the team composition.

I think Rohit is the only cricketer in the world who gets lot of criticism irrespective of his performance...guys give a break to him...he played well within limitations in this series (frankly speaking  I did not expect that he will become 2nd highest scorer in this series)...he played only 14 test matches i.e. less than all others, having healthy average of 40, but he oftenly throw his wicket at crucial juncture, hope he will correct his weakness and play long innings like Pujara...our core test team should be---Vijay, Dhawan, Pujara, Kohli, Rahane, Rohit, Naman Ojha/Sanju Samson, Mishra, Ashwin, Bhuvi, Ishant, Shami, Binny, Yadav, KL Rahul...15 member squad

i am not a rohit critic nor a fan but the obvious remains, the selectors job does not merit conditions/performances for what they are selecting the team for... overall averages can be misguiding at times. i cld have a fantastic averaging batsmen but completely out of form or if i am selecting for a SA tour have a very poor record performing there (applicable to bowlers as well). The SELECTION process should incorporate looking at:  
1. performances of individuals at same or similar conditions (pitch/environment), 
2. performance of the individual against the opposition individual bowlers/batsmen (whichever apply)
3. current form of the batsman (this may be done but sometimes the name of the batsman/bowler overrides the stat)
4. current physical condition of the batsman (this is done)
5. and whichever others factors you can think of and are applicable ... 
6. this all should apply to the captain as well.

Cricinfo, Can you please stop having this requirement of having an article for each team EVERY DAY? The article about Pujara (the other day) was enjoyable because there was much to write about the player and the performance. I am not undermining Rohit's knock, it was a very crucial one that got India out of a hole. But, it feels as if this article has been written 'just to make the numbers'. I am not criticizing Sharda or Andrew here, but request you to take a look at your requirement of coming out with an article, no matter whether there is  relevant content or not.

The article has zero analysis of the facts but basically a mouthpiece for Rohit interview. It could have been titled, "transcript of Rohit's interview." Rohit was interviewed by Cricinfo back in Nov last year, when out injured and he bristled at the suggestion that Rahane should can keep his opening spot in ODIs. "If sachin comes back at opens, why you guys ask me these questions" and "nothing will change everything will remain same". Suggesting that opening is some sort of birthright for Mumbai batsman. Now that he has been favorably pushed down the order he is talking about "oh its team management, they decided, i agreed" Ofcourse you agreed, you took spot from Puj who is natural #3 saying you are better, then you asked Rahane to shield you by taking his spot in batting order. One also questions who posts such softball questions to these guys, it sounds almost orchestrated. What you expect Rohit will say "oh ya I was being shielded by team management" ?

Rohit is by far the best batsman in the Indian team and the most stylish batsman in the Indian team since Sunil Gavaskar. He, however, struggles with temperament. But, having played only 14 tests, temperament will come with age and experience. I believe he should bat at 4, and Kohli at 5 and India should play 6 batsmen till they find a better keeper/batsman than Saha/Ojha. So, my top 6 -- Vijay/Dhawan/Rahul, Rahul/Pujara, Rohit, Kohli, Rahane

I would offer a better solution to the selection problem: Change the captain. Make that guy as captain who can play with 4 bowlers. Surprising to see the search for elusive allrounder. Ganguly almost always played with 4 bowlers. So did, Dravid and Azhar. Partly due to Kumble, who can bowl tirelessly. Its here that Ashwin and Mishra need top step up. i.e. plot dismissals by bowling long spells. Make, Dhawan, Kohli, Rohit to bowl a bit more. Didn't Ganguly even opened bowling as medium pacer in tests? Why are today's cricketers shirking responsibilities? India has always been a good team with 7-4 combination and not 5-1-4. Rohit deserves a place in the 11, so does Pujara. At least for the SA series. Would have liked Pujara as captain, as he selects himself first on the team sheet than anyone else.

Why did Ashwin not get an article after his monumental score? And What about Mishra that was pivotal with the bat in both innings? If a No.3/No.5 full time batsman scores a 50 and gets into headlines, why not bowlers that get those 10 wickets and still manage such valuable runs, not recognized?

Spot on buddy - that was what Pujara was doing all the time, even in those away tours where he failed (along with everyone else), but he was protecting them by playing lot of balls for his 30s and 40s. What Rohit did in this one innings, Pujara has been doing it all his career.

Good knock Rohit, well played. But this is not an achievement, about time you started paying back for all the confidence shown in you. If you do not perform in the next match, if you are selected that is, I would love to give you #3 position for an extended run, in the India A team. :)

@SPORTOFPAiN: You are missing the point. Fans are upset when the best batsmen Pujara gets benched to make room for Rohit(Test 1)  &amp; vacate his #3 spot for Rahane(Test 2 &amp; 3), when he has an established Test spot at #3 with the best average. It is fine for Rohit to say "he can bat at any spot" &amp; nobody owns a spot. I don't agree. Each spot in Tests requires certain skills. Rohit is all at sea when playing on  spinning or Seaming pitches because he lacks the footwork &amp; technique. He is talented &amp; has got excellent hand-Eye coordination &amp; fast reflexes which aids him on good batting surfaces. That's a fact. Pujara was made a scapegoat to accommodate a Mumbai player at all costs. That is unfair &amp; unjust in Democratic India!

Now that Rohit has scored a half century KL Rahul's place would be in question. Few days back Manjrekar was saying he is a certainty after scoring 2 centuries - Not really. Pujara might replace him in number 3 and Rohit has a better chance of continuing at number 5 over Rahul. 
</p>
<p>
BTW, Naman Ojha has been really impressive . He handled Sri Lankan bowling with ease , although could not score a lot of runs. He is going to give Shah tough fight for that WK position once he comes back.

@Nampally: Vinod Kambli has a higher average than Sachin in tests. Does that make him a better bat? Batting averages can be misleading in the short term. Rohit has only played 14 tests. After he plays 100 tests comparison of averages AND strike rates will make sense. Right now enjoy his talent and ability as well as Pujara's temperament and tenacity

Rohit Sharma scored 202 runs because he played 6 innings. @ an average of  33 runs/innings. Pujara was considered totally out of form when he was averaging 24.5/innings on overseas tour whilst his overall Test average remained high- currently 50!  But the irony is Pujara(an established #3) was dropped for 2 Tests to make room for Rohit with much lower batting average. Pujara got into this Test only because of injuries to the opener + lost his #3 spot &amp; had to open the innings. But Pujara answered his benching in an emphatic manner by averaging 145 in this Test series! Is inclusion of Rohit at the expense of Pujara justified? India should play 6 bats + an all rounder to justify Rohit, Pujara &amp; Rahane all playing in XI. That is the only acceptable solution to this issue.

wtf? Rohit dint do anything extra-ordinary this match. why is sharda praising him. Is she from Mumbai too? I feel, he is occupying a place in the team, which Pujara deserves. We can only feel bad for the poor guy Pujara, even after such a good performance, he has to sacrifice his place in the next matches.

So many Rohit bashers out there - at 7 for 3 the guy comes in and scores a clutch 50 and people undermine that by saying others who came after him also got runs. Maybe he was successfully 'protecting' them so they could score. The guy has only played 14 tests even though he made his ODI debut about 7 years ago. All the others in the batting order have played more tests than him even though they came after him - Kohli 37 tests, Pujara 28 tests, Rahane 17 tests, Dhawan 15 tests. So he has actually been starved of opportunities - these 14 tests have also not been continuous - usually he gets 2-3 tests then gets dropped. To those who have watched / played the game, his ability is very obvious. Give the guy a break and stop criticizing him when he doesn't score and even when he scores. He will score a triple century in tests and will also get 25 centuries in 100 tests. You read this here.  Lastly, remember that if you praise Rohit you are not criticizing someone else.

Purely from performance perspective, our top 6 should be Vijay, Dhawan, Pujara, Kohli, Rahane and Saha/Ojha.  Rohit's average in Tests speaks about his inconsistency and he should be dropped with immediate effect. He throws away his wicket when it matters the most and just because Kohli favors him, he is in the team.  He has been given a longer rope than usual because of his talent, which no doubt he has, but he doesn't have the temperament to score big runs in Test cricket. You go for your shots, but you need good shot selection as well to score big in Tests, classic example being Sehwag, who was too aggressive, but an impact player and his average in Tests, speaks for themselves.  Long story short, Rohit needs to make way for batsmen like Pujara and Rahane, who are more deserving and have better Test averages.

Credit due where its due, Rohit batted well, but Pujara has leapfrogged him for now. If India plays 5 specialist batsman in the next match against SA, i'll be very surprised to see Rohit in, if India plays 6 though, then Rohit slots as the 6th batsman. But i guess Binny with a strong showing has more or less booked his place for the next match. Good innings, not really a match winning one though, neither does it make any statement!!

@NAMPALLY Others scored runs but he scored runs against the new ball, when it was moving... He could have got out like the top 3

Congrats Rohit for your valuable innings today.. But..,of all the Indian Batsmen.., only Kohli,Rohit,Rahane &amp; Rahul played all the three test matches &amp; hence he has ended up as the second highest scorer behind Kohli.. Once Vijay &amp; Dhawan return i think the axe should fall on Rahul &amp; Rohit as Pujara &amp; Rahane have made some tough runs in England,Australia &amp; now Srilanka.. The two most technically vulnerable batsmen in our regular batting lineup are Kohli &amp; Rohit.. Kohli cannot sitout as he is the captain  (Also he performed excellently on the hard wickets in Australia..,but needs to improve his technique against the moving ball &amp; improve upon his temperament if he wishes to succeed in all conditions..),so it should be rohit who should be dropped.. He has been given a very very long rope i think.. He is definitely talented,but doesn't deserve a spot in the Test team..

Rohit might be prepared to bat at any position but based on competition he cannot be in XI when only 5 bats are needed. Sure Rohit scored a 50 in the second innings but Ashwin(@#9) got 58, Binny got 49 &amp; Mishra 39, Ojha 35 in the same innings. Fortunately the ball was seaming much less on Day 4 to make this possible. India's top 4 are :Vijay, Dhawan, Pujara &amp; Kohli based on performance record &amp; excluding politics. #5 is between Rahane &amp;  Rohit. If there are 6 bats Rohit gets in like VVS Laxmandid.  If Kumar,Binny, Shankar or Ashwin, can be trained as genuine all rounder, 6 bats are possible. This is where some fine tuning is crucial. Hope BCCI take this up seriously!

Differences apart, I congratulate Rohit on his timely 50 in the second innings that helped IND to get to a dominant position in this test. Liked his response on - its the captain &amp; Mgmt decision who to pick and where to play, I just play my game. Wish it were that easy for the blokes that have to constantly sit out.

I guess now since Pujara is back with a bang, kohli will look at benching Rahane to fit Rohit in. The constant is Rohit IN, the variable is which of Pujara/Rahane out. Is n't that right?

yes!!! what Rohit said is absolutely correct..the same media and critics who are barking now for the shot he played when he got out... would have clapped and told he is such a good puller of ball if it had gone for six or four...he is one such player who always put team first...give him time he will make that 5 th position his own...

Why should a team mess around an batting order to just accommodate one guy? Why should Pujara score 150 (as per gavaskar) to be considered while just a 50 is enough for this guy? Did he even touch the balls Steyn bowled in SA last year? Did he score truckloads of runs down under last year??

Rohit is talented sure but talent needs to materalize on field in tests to justify test place. If scoring 50 is considered delivering, then Ashwin and Mishra also scored 50s on same deck

From the article - "Fitting Rohit into the batting order has been tricky issue for the team". This, really, is the ONLY issue. Winning test matches? Never mind, when was that an issue at all? Funny thing, this aggressive mantra; for one batsman, its okay to say that he doesn't fit into their plans; for another, the team management has to try and fit him in. Anyway, it was a crucial 50 runs he added - leaves Kohli and Shastri with a nice headache once Dhawan and Vijay recovers. Which of the following three will make the cut for the one remaining spot - Rahul, Rahane or Pujara? My best guess - Rahane will be selected, but be put on notice even as Rahul and Pujara will have to wait for another injury or two.

'Flair' and 'Aggression' make sense when they are backed up by runs... Look what happened to AUS in Ashes? Would they want someone with 'flair' and 'aggression' in that team or someone with a level head to read the situation, the pitch, the bowler and bat sensibly? Playing with 5 batsmen means after 3 wickets you have your last recognized pair batting, which means you always need one person in a partnership play an anchor role. Rahane and Pujara are capable of several such partnerships.

What else do you expect the support staff to say, when the captain and team director openly announced Rohit to play at No.3? Can he really give his honest opinion and risk his own job? He used the word 'flair' because he cannot come up with anything better to say about Rohit...otherwise who in the world is looking for flair in a No.3? Check all the most successful No.3s in the world, current and past...how many have this 'flair'?

I am sure on some placid pitch, in some in consequential match, against some ordinary/tired attack....Rohit will soon hit a 300 in tests that will carry him over for the next 3 years and overshadows the kind of partnerships that Pujara was able to build even when he is so out of form.

Rohit fans are the most calm people to back a person who did nothing for 8 years ,except 2 double century and when he goes to overseas even mcgrath plays better."whereas players like rahane, pujara[with due respect to them] always keep looking at sky after every shot " seriously you need to watch them play cricket u got every thing wrong there, they would never play a rash shot.

There is no doubt (echoed by other comments) that the captain and director (Shastriji) have big issues with Pujara (and maybe even Rahane?). They can't seem to acknowledge the fact that you need a solid #3 who's done his bit by going to England and averaging in the mid 40s. They want to stick with duds like Raina and Rohit. In fact, it appears like Kohli is becoming a bit divisive in terms of his captaincy what with his hot headedness and all. The sooner Kohli gets his head screwed on and his act together, the better, otherwise, he'll realize pretty quickly that he's setting himself and the team up for failure. This type of crony-coterie factions doesn't bode well at all for Indian cricket.

rohit sharma is truly an enigma. he's got diehards fans &amp; die hard critics as well. the entire discussion centering around him is proof of his charismatic batting. he's in the team not for nothing. when so many former players r backing him, then v should wait &amp; watch. he has disappointed many a times with some so called reckless shots, but that's one point of view. what  I see is-he's never cowed down by any situation/criticism. always looking to take on the opposition. whereas players like rahane, pujara[with due respect to them] always keep looking at sky after every shot as if requesting god to save them. if the skipper wants rohit, he should let him have. lastly u can love rohit, hate rohit, but cant ignore him. if he clicks, he can change the match on its head in a session. hope he succeeds &amp; so should team india,

Rohit is a marvel to watch with his approach to batting but tends to get complacent with his lazy nature..
</p>
<p>
All round he is one of the best timers of a cricket ball and I know India will benefit from his contributions going forward..
</p>
<p>
I've always rated him,Kohli and Raina highly but the emergence of Rahane doesn't go unnoticed.. I remember Rahane taking a charge against a form Australian pace attack and clattering Johnson to all parts of the ground..
</p>
<p>
Sadly Raina is a ODI and T20 specialist now but with Rohit,Kohli and Rahane batting in that order then India will be a force going forward and will fare better on overseas pitches in the future..
</p>
<p>
Rohit is class and on his day he can take a game away from the opposition, he needs to be given more time to develop..
</p>
<p>
He has scored 2 double centuries in ODI's and that speaks volumes..

@mohan It is clear that you are rohit fan your last word luck for rohit says it all you want rohit in team but india to lose,He will play as your politics ,If he plays well here or not will you play pujara oly in overseas then why u need him there ,I am not asking for pujara any one except him even kid will play well, I don't know what in the world how you said he is weak against off spin ,that is hilarious.Technique ,so called technical batsmen haven't played single match convincing in his 8 years , If he is weak then rohit don't know how to play seam what is your take on that as in srilanka it will reverse swing in morning itself even sachin and dravid struggled. Now rules changed in odi we will see how his mistimed shots falls in no mans land his luck started ly when powerplay is there.Even he performs or not vijay,rahane and ashwin gona win the match for india[true fans].

The main qualities one should look for in a number 3 in test cricket are: solidity, reliability, sound technique.  Flair is a secondary consideration.  Rohit at number 3 will set the team up for failure.  Rahul or Pujara would be better at number 3.  The ideal batting line-up based on recent performances if you are only going to have 5 batsmen - Vijay, Dhawan, Rahul, Kohli, Rahane.

Now rules changed in odi we will see how his mistimed shots falls in no mans land his luck started ly when powerplay is there.Even he performs or not vijay,rahane and ashwin gona win the match for india[true fans].

The main qualities one should look for in a number 3 in test cricket are: solidity, reliability, sound technique.  Flair is a secondary consideration.  Rohit at number 3 will set the team up for failure.  Rahul or Pujara would be better at number 3.  The ideal batting line-up based on recent performances if you are only going to have 5 batsmen - Vijay, Dhawan, Rahul, Kohli, Rahane.

India wants same 'flair' that Dravid had. Not a slogging, hard hitting, risky flair but calm, composed, reliable kind of flair. I think we have seen those things in Pujara and hence he should bat at No 3. Pujara has all the strokes in a book if you are putting 'stroke-maker' condition on No 3. Firstly I don't think Rohit Sharma deserves to play in Test team and even if he does, he shouldn't bat at No 3.

This is a ham handed attempt to keep Pujara out - Kohli seems to have issues with him. 
</p>
<p>
Rohit's place in the test team is questionable, leave alone being No. 3
</p>
<p>
He and Kohli are similar players and only one of them should play in the test team. I would even say India should play all three - Vijay, Rahul and Pujara in the test XI. Kohli, Rahane and Dhawan are enough aggressive batsmen in the team.
</p>
<p>
For the limited overs, I agree Rohit is a better bet than Pujara and should be preferred.

If you are going with 5 specialist batsman with 2 useless test players (Virat Kohli &amp; NoHit Sharma), you can very well hand over the trophy to the lankans before the start of the series. My 5 batsman 1) Vijay 2) Dhawan 3) KL Rahul 4) Pujara 5) Rahane.

Oxford dictionary defines Flair as talent or skill one has. However Rohit's flair is only confined to Nets. His Test average, according to Bangar excluding centuries vs. WI,  is just 23! My concern is Rohit's footwork &amp; defence are poor - 2 main requirements for a successful #3 Test batsmen. The #3 spot is for the sheet anchor who is excellent at playing all types of bowling particularly fast Seam bowlers. Why is Rohit groomed for #3 spot when his defence &amp; footwork is so poor? These are the fundamentals of batting that one grows up with. It is strange to see the Indian batting coach pushing Rohit for #3 spot while admitting his weakness vs. Seam bowling- which clearly disqualifies him for Test XI,  let alone #3 spot!

There is no doubt that Rohit is an asset- the kind of talent that he is and the range of his strokeplay. He is one player who cannot be fixed as fit for a particular batting slot.  But there seems to be a certain amount of obduracy about making Rohit open in ODIs and bat at No. 3 in tests. Perhaps Kohli is trying to be aggressive. It may work out and I hope it does. But my concern is that we have natural openers in Dhawan, Vijay, Rahane and K L Rahul and an experienced No. 3 in Pujara. Especially, No.3 is far more important slot than an opener- Rahul Dravid, Kumar Sangakkara, Ricky Ponting, why even The Great Don have proven it. This is not to put pressure on Rohit but to state the importance of the position that Rohit is being entrusted with. A rash shot, a flamboyant flash to the slips is the last one expects from him. Let him be reminded that he is the neck that connects the head with the body. Hope he does not become a bottleneck to India's batting. Best Wishes, Team India!

i'm sure people who are saying rohit does not have technique to bat at 3 don't know anything about batting.rohit averages around 60 in ranji trophy.he has both flair and technique which only great batsman can observe.mark my words-ROHIT SHARMA will end his career as a legend and his haters will regret that day.he is a modern day great which time will tell to his critics.

Rohit may bring flair, but not too many runs. Last time Rohit played in Sri Lanka he threatened to break Agarkar's run of 0s in Australia. My choice would be to have Dhawan open with Vijay and have Rahul come in at 3 especially now that all 3 are in good nick.

@kunakrish u r taking it personal here and this is not right that u r saying that I have played cricket or not. I have no knowledge of cricket. We r not going to sit in exams here. This is cricket man. don't take it by so hard. I know and u also know that Pujara can not play well off spin. He has also technique problems and also lacking in temparament. That's why he is out of squad. I think u r big fan of Pujara but this time is not a player like that he used to play sometimes.  May be u have good knowledge of cricket. I think Rohit is going to play good this series and luck turns from here for Rohit and he will play test for India for a long time. Plz kunakrish no comments.

If we are playing 6 batsmen and 5 bowlers : 3 of the batsman are in form VIJAY,RAHANE and DHAWAN (recent matches)  while 3 of them : VIRAT, SAHA, ROHIT/PUJARA are not in form. If our team management wants flair and have sitting ducks as 3 batsman why not try RAYUDU as batsman/wicket keeper. Also Rahul was playing good in tour match why not give him added responsibility of wicket keeper in the tour match.Can selectors/team management be honest on where they stand before the test matches and be little proactive as england selectors are? Virat Kohli wants to win matches with aggressive bowlers but we need to get our batting order right. Good luck Virat and his new team !!

Surely, Rohit brings flair of failure.  I agree Pujara ha struggled of lately and promoting Rohit to #3 is a ploy to wake up Pujara, I get it.  Other the that Rohit is inconsistent, lost and lacks temperament.  This is a test cricket and not 20 or 50 overs game.  They ball 90 overs everyday for 5 days and Rohit is required to be consistent and bat for a long period of time-something that he hasn't shown he is capable yet.  Anyway, I wish him all the best and hope he delivers

Everyone criticizing Rohit Sharma should understand that India are playing in the sub-continent, where scoring runs quickly on flat pitches in Sri Lanka is important. Pujara has a strike rate of about 40 which is seriously not enough. When overseas tours come Indian team will play Pujara. Dont think about Rohit performing overseas now. Think about sub-continent and flat pitches

@Mohan now proved that you don't have any knowledge about cricket ,just stat reader ,Have you ever played cricket or have watched pujara and rohit play in those test matches. In england pujara and vijay are main reason india given a fight and in one test he played he could have made the match draw and played a pathetic shot ,Have you watched how pujara played in green top .And have you watched how he holded one end in australia which would have been a humiliating defeat. Rohit not given chance because he can't even play well in odi in overseas .Are you seriously telling about west indies and pujara also played better than him in subcontinent .

When Pujara was playing in SA his average was above 60. but after playing newzealand england and Australia his average is 47. It shows he was big failure because he has tag of next Dravid. At no. 3 His performance was not good enough after these tours so he lost his position. May be Pujara is better than Rohit? but this time Pujara is also not doing well so Virat moves on and he thinks Rohit deserves at no. 3 then why so much tauba tauba.

Mr. Kunakrish I think u do not follow cricket regularly. u do not know that Pujara played 5 matches in england, was big failure after virat he made some thing 220 runs in 10 innings with 1 half century. In Australia he made only one century something 73 runs and failed in next matches and finally he dropped for Rohit. In newzealand he was so horrible. he could not made at least one half century. U count these test and total is 10 tests. Rohit plays at international level from 2007 t20 WC. He has been dropped regularly after one series because that time India's middle order was very strong with yuvi dhoni and Raina so he could not make a permanent spot in team but when he came to open the result shows how he is consistent. If People say that he does not play good outside India thay are so blind.  in westindies he has the best records. in Aus he has good records and England too. He has not records in SA regarding odi. In test he did not do good enough.

After this series Rohit bashers will be quiet  because he will prove u all wrong. Who says he has not good technique. he has a decent technique to play test. he has some issues like shot selection and hitting unnecessarily. In last 8 years he is not playing every match he has been dropped after 1or 2 matches. After he became opener he is more consistent and playing well. He will do better in tests also. have patience  cricket lovers. Virat knows what he is doing wrong or good. Rahul is a good player no doubt. Pujara is also good player but he is not good enough at this time. he was big failure in 8-10 tests that's why he lost his position. Rohit played 3 times at no.3 made a half century. He has to give chance at no. 3 more. Why u taking so much tension his failures in practise game. he will do better this time. Come on Rohit and India.

Pujara did work hard on his technique in county cricket. He averages 47 in tests and he is a very good player in sub continent conditions. In the current Indian Test team ,pujara is the best player of spin. He did bat better than rohit in practice match. What else should he prove to get a place in playing XI. Meanwhile Saha has to score runs. Batting at 6 he should score runs or else india must find a good wk batsman. Naman ojha is already 30+.

Anybody criticizing Rohit here is not looking at this right.. If Rahul and Vijay open the batting, then playing Pujara at 3 does not make sense whatsoever.. He is a terrific cricketer, but considering the team composition and what the management wants for the team, he will never make it to this 11.. And playing 5 bowlers is the best thing India has learnt since the horrific Australian summer where we did not take 20 wickets in a single game.. Give Ashwin and Mishra the opportunity to showcase their talent.. Play Aaron, Yadav and Sharma.. Going back to Harbhajan is regressive.. He has not taken any wickets in the last first class season..

Rohit Sharma is a big liability for India, but you will never here that , why because the Indian captain is Virat Kolhi. If batsmen were picked on form and ability India would play, 1.Murali Vijay, 2 Shikhar Dhawan, 3. Lokesh Rahul 4. Virat Kohli 5. Ajinkye Rahane 6. Wriddhiman Saha (whom is not up to the wicketkeeping job), 7. Ravichandran Ashwin, 8. Bhuvneshwar Kumar 9. Axar Patel 10. Sanju Samson 11. Umesh Yadav. But that batting top 5 would mean Virat Kohli being the weakest batsmen in the lineup, and to make Virat look better a poor batmen needs to be selected in test matches hence you play Rohit Sharma, whom doesn't like to run for 1's or 2's and just likes hitting boundaries or getting out if he can't hit them. Rohit Sharma is poor, and after 2 tests in Sri Lanka this will become obvious. Most teams go with the most inform players but not India because Virat needs someone who is in worse form than him, to make him look good and that is Rohit 'nohit' Sharma.

I am yet to see that flair from Rohit Sharma in test cricket. He is useless and out of defense when it comes to play against solid bowling lineup. AndMr.Bangar , please tell us when is the last time your not-so-talented Rohit stayed on the crease by facing more than 50 deliveries in a test cricket ? Rest in Peace Indian test cricket !

I get sick of hearing the statement that you need flair at no.3 to win test matches. You may need it but never at the cost of stability and assurance. Its this reason why Dravid batted at number 3 for so many years for India. Even an inform Laxman hardly replaced him at that position, because that generation knew the importance of solidity at no. 3. Steven Smith, who was almost Bradmanesque over the last 12 months, seemed found out in swinging conditions at 3. So please use your brains and pick anyone (Rahul or Pujara, maybe even push Kohli if you so want to play Rohit) who puts a value on his wicket.
Such antics are making me lose interest in Indian cricket.

I get sick of hearing the statement that you need flair at no.3 to win test matches. You may need it but never at the cost of stability and assurance. Its this reason why Dravid batted at number 3 for so many years for India. Even an inform Laxman hardly replaced him at that position, because that generation knew the importance of solidity at no. 3. Steven Smith, who was almost Bradmanesque over the last 12 months, seemed found out in swinging conditions at 3.

Looks like Rohit is a certain candidate at No.3 ahead of two solid test players --Pujara and Rahul. Rohit is not in the team based on performances, but because of dirty politics. It would be a pleasure for most of the true Indian fans to watch Rohit fail miserably in this series, not because of hatred towards Rohit, but because of the dirty politics. The same dirty Indian politics has kept the current best test player, Rahane waiting for 2 years on bench. Remember that even Jadeja made his debut while Rahane was benched.

Suddenly Getting the feeling that India have stopped producing batsmen with strong technique and temperament , the current crop of players who can play T20, and ODI's but cannot adapt to test cricket. Is it one of the side effects of T20 cricket overdose.??Lets Look at the current team(1.Vijay(Good) 2.Dhawan(shaky form ,will b tested agnst strng bowling ),3.rohit(no comments)4,Virat (dip in form)5.rahane(Class)6.Rahul(early stage of his carrier)7.saha(no signs of improvement)8.Ashwin(impressive in sub continental conditions)9.Bhajji(back from wilderness)10.ishant(spear head bowl avg close to 38 in testsLOL) 11.Shami(donno how he will bowl once he back from injury) this side i guess will for sure struggle against a stronger opposition

Rohit is not a good choice at no.3... He may be successful in flat pitches and against poor bowling attack but not in tough and challenging condition and good bowling side... He is more a T20 kind of player,,, Not good enough to test level... In fact V,Kohli is also struggling in fast, seaming and spin track...

Probably one of the top 5 greatest Indian batsmen, Laxsman, took 3 or 4 years of test cricket before he scored a century. Players need to be given time before they can do well and find themselves. Some will succeed, some will not and every player is unique in how he succeeds or fails. Rohit started his test career well, however he has not performed to expectations in Australia and NZ. He did not get a consistent string of starts due to the team composition. It is way too early to give up on him. He has the skills.  There is a lot of competition to either perform or be dropped, it is as simple as that. We have good competition for openers, for number 3 position and the rest of the slots as well. Vijay has solidified his position with consistency and excellent performances and temperament. KL Rahul will be given chances to start this series and deserves so. Dhawan will get chances as well as he is the lone left hander in the squad.

It is a big disapointment to see Rahul and Pujara both likely to sit out of the test. Playing Rohit ahead of  Pujara is very unfortunate (Kohli style). It makes no sense going with 6-5 when there are only 5 batsmen and another yet to perform on the big stage. It is better to go with 7-4 combo in the first test since No.3 &amp; 4 failed in both the innings of the practice game.  My XI: Vijay, Rahul, Pujara, Kohli, Rahane, Rohit, Saha, Ashwin, Harbhajan, Kumar/Aaron, Ishant

Rohit is a great stroke maker, doesn't mean he's a great batsman. Ppl in world cricket need to understand the difference... He doesn't have a solid defensive technique to be a no. 3... The top 3 have to be solid in test cricket... Rahul plz at 3...

Its subcontinental season. He will eventually perform in some in consequnetial match. Looking forward to SA tour. I remember when Steyn taunted him and Rohit response was with his mouth - "Come to India". Cant wait to see that. Infact Steyn has got 6 for in India.

Luckiest Man in the world ,every one said dhoni is luckiest .Even cricket columnist,fans and media [Except mumbai] know he is worth less and whole nation want pujara or rahul should be there ,but the endorsement and politics is doing its part ,this is why we need foreign coach.Clark failed in two series he retired and this so called talent man failed for 8 years he is still talented and big score around corner i know that big is  in india against minnows or tootless bowling attack ,even history says the same thing.

Bangar himself doesn't deserve a spot in the setup. And he comes out supporting two others like him. Great. @NoName1- "Nothing other than black magic explains the situation..." ROFL buddy. Best comment of the day probably. @PULKITK, let's do one thing. Let Rohit play 80-100 matches and let us enjoy the hundreds he gets in between. Does that make you happy? Dude, think about players whose careers are getting smashed in this process. You don't seem to have any idea about that. @ANKIT.SHARMA, thank you for putting out the stats. @NoName2, yes man. Even I don't remember any player getting as many chances as Rohit. I think he got more than 100 games to come good in ODIs. Really harsh on players who are waiting. @COOLJACK_143, hahahaha. Yeah, it's become more of a lip service.

This is exactly the way Indian cricket works.......VVS Laxman was always kept on the edge despite being consistent...here we have Mr.Inconsistent, Rohit Sharma who is being praised for flair. This Mr.Bangar is the difference in the treatment meted out to players from Mumbai and players from rest of the country. Mumbai players are given a long rope(which continues post retirement)....Pragyan Ojha despite good performances in domestic cricket does not find a place in the team.

I hope India can somehow play a test series in England next month on green wickets with Rohit at No. 3. Give him the whole series and then drop him permanently after he has scored enough single digit scores. Dhoni's big mistake was not giving enough chances to Rohit in England. Had he played 3-4 tests especially  at Lords and the last 2 tests we wouldn't be having this discussion today.

Reg Rohit, yes "it's a matter of time he performs" sick to hear this same quote for ever now since years &amp; years. I am feeling that he will retire with the same quote too. Let's hope he performs someday.hope is a good thing to have

Playing Rohit, is giving a free wicket to Srilanka. In entire world's cricket history no one would have got chances like rohit. Many years of failures in one day, then after several years few knocks in INDIA. In tests leaving debut series in India, he is a total failure. Indians should stop watching cricket if these useless guys are given more chances. Pujara is a class player he lost his place just after few failures.

@PULKITK well rohit was given enough chances . he played 8 innings in sa n nz before he was dropped. n apart from everyone scored. and after that team needed to play five bowler obv he had to be dropped and when he got picked he played careless shots in 3rd test in eng , 1str n 2nd test in aus again got 4 innings and threw his wickets at crucial times. and then in last again made a 50 n threw his wkt. He shud b thankful to kohli for making him bat at 3. now its high time he shud make runs rather than throwing his wickets. You cant blow up so many chances on the word talent. had he been in aus he would have been kept on bench like shaun marsh . N talking about steve smith he is highly consistent n technique is an overrated word. Also it wud be unfair if kl rahul had to be dropped coz now even dhawan has scored runs n he is the only left hander so he is important for combination. He himself hasnt been consistent no even in odi despite getting so many chances

We don't need flair Mr. Bangar, we need someone who can dig in at no 3. To me K L Rahul or Pujara should be at no 3.

Rohit brings FAILURE at no. 3...It will be so foolish if India decides to play him instead of Pujara or even Rahul at no. 3 but unfortunately he is the first choice of captain and coaches. Not only is it going to backfire for India in longer term, it is also going to keep promising batsmen for the crucial spot out of the team.

For those who say that Rohit is not a Test material should know that he hasn't been given continuous Tests to prove his worth in Test matches... He has always been left out of the playing XI after 1 or 2 matches.. And those who are questioning his technique remember that he has far better technique than Aus' no.3 Steven Smith and so if he can score runs at that position why can't Rohit... He should be given a chance to prove himself at no.3

Rohit is a very talented player, however he doesn't have the technique for a number 3 yet. Maybe the indian team should give him a chance to prove himself at 3 and see if he adapts. But one thing for sure he can win matches for you!
</p>
<p>
I think Shikhar Dhawan doesn't have the technique in overseas conditions. In Asia, absolutely he does. But you would like to invest your time in someone who is able to perform in foreign conditions and you want a team what will win you games in overseas conditions. For me I think KL Rahul needs to be in the indian team and so does Pujara. 
</p>
<p>
If India were to play 6 specialist batsman the 11 I'll have include ;
</p>
<p>
M.Vijay,KL Rahul,R Sharma,V Kohli,A Rahane,CA Pujara, R Ashwin, W. Saha,H. Singh, U Yadav, I. Sharma 
</p>
<p>
Virat likes the idea of 5 bowlers and with 5 bowlers the ideal team in my opinion would include: 
M.Vijay, KL.Rahul,R.Sharma,V. Kohli,A.Rahane,R. Ashwin,W.Saha,H. Singh,U.Yadav,V.Aaron/B Kumar(depending on conditions),I. Sharma
