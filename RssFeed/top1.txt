Dhawan needed a match like this with no real RR pressure to score few runs. Going by his career success rate (1 innings of some substance every 10-12 innings), he may have done his bit for this IPL.

GL batting looks top heavy ( no i am not referring to  the stocky build of Finch or excess weight Raina seems to be carrying ) with a long tail with Jadeja coming at no.5, they should get another Indian batsman , whatever happened to Ishant Kishan who has not played after the first match and was singled out of praise by there coach Brad Hogde .

Poor caotaincy from Warner... By now,  every local and international captain would be knowing the way to restrict Raina... Its not rocket science... If Raina scores thats direct question on captaincy... Otherwise pretty good day for sunrisers

There was a time KKR would restrict opponents 20 runs below par. Sunrisers will restrict opponents 30 runs below par when Yuvi and Nehra comes back. Nehra and Buvi at the opening... Mustafiz would not be as dangerous when the ball is not gripping but the thought of him bowling 3 overs in the last 5... that will effect the other teams. Raina was middling the ball, still did not go after Mustafiz.  Buzz was playing ok, but not-scoring at one over made him worried. Nehra would be very effective/economical.  They can win the IPL. Their core is so powerful. If they keep Warner, Mustafiz and Nehra they can always build a team around these three.

Resounding win and we are out of the bottom !! As I had commented in the preview, GL has the worst middle order and they got exposed thoroughly. I will be very surprised if they qualify for the knockouts. We had an almost perfect game in all three departments. Still I find it a tad unfair that Ashish Reddy was dropped to bring in Tare. Ashish has performed beyond his capabilities and delivered good performances in all the games so far. Either Dhawan or Ojha should have made way. As predicted Dhawan has shown "form" - but it will not escape the scrutiny of tactical guys like MS that a quality off-spinner can easily shut out this opening combo - which is why Williamson at the top of the order (when he recovers) is an absolute must. Our next match is against Punjab and I am 100% sure that Maxwell will bowl in the power play. I hope our "think tank" comes up with some tactics rather than play formula cricket. Hooda bowling was a welcome change and gives more options. Go SRH !!!

Dhawan, Warner, Kane, Ojha/Tare, Henriques, Yuvraj, Hooda, Bipul/Sran, Nehra, Fizz, Bhuvi are my choice.

Henriques can be replaced with Morgan in case Sran is playing.

It was vintage SRH! Restricting teams to low totals and chasing them down. The team had a poor start to the season but it appears to have gained some confidence. Great. Now that they have some momentum, lets see how they fare till game 7. Certainly the return of Nehra, Yuvraj, and Kane will fortify them. Dhawan finally scored some runs but it is of no use if he is one match wonder. Their weak areas are middle and lower order, they lack good spin options. Will be wonderful to watch if they field below team:
</p>
<p>
SRH Best XI: 1 Warner 2 Dhawan 3 Kane 4 Ojha 5 Morgan 6 Yuvraj 7 Hooda 8 Bhuvi 9 Nehra 10 Mustafizur 11 Sran

AND to me is the silent killer who takes the game away from opposition before even they realize.

Fizz also helped other bowlers to get wickets because of his tight bowling in one end.

<p>
 It does not matter weather he gets wicket or not but still exciting to watch his each and every ball he delivers.

SRH got very good bowling unit this year, once Nehra is back it will be even stronger.

Finally, Dhawan due for a decent score.  Yes, he scores a 50 or 100 every 10 matches and now he can twirl his mustache.  The next one will come may be at the fag end of IPL.

Dhawan coming back tosome sort of form is very good for Sunrisers,but it's lame to keep Kane Williamson out, they are heavily reliant on Warnar which is not healthy as per team combination goes. Wonder when would Yuvraj nd Nehra wld be back, that wld make them a lot stronger.Mustafizur, mate pls keep up your good work and continue to make us proud.

Just shows that GL were winning mostly because of Aaron finch and his failure exposed thier fragile batting.Karthik, bravo and jadeja have not really done much with the bat of late. Dale steyn should have completed his quota of overs. Picking him and just giving him two overs is poor captaincy. He should have been relied upon to give a breakthrough considering the small target

Though Buvhi has taken a four for but it was Mustafiz who has controlled the middle and end overs from which Gujarat Lions couldn't come across to post a huge total. Hats off to the cutter master, Mustafiz; what a lovely bowler BD has produced!

Gujarath's over dependency on Finch is exposed . SRH is gelling up as a team very well.Dhawan ATLAST scored 50 .. but it is evident he is out of form .

Dhawan finally scored some runs but it is of no use if he is one match wonder. Their weak areas are middle and lower order, they lack good spin options. Will be wonderful to watch if they field below team:

Good show by David-Dhawan duo. and bowlers particularly Bhuvi and Fiz. Poor tacktics by Lions to not have a prope right arm offf spinner to counter to two lefties in the middle. Hope they learn

Most one sided match yet in this year's IPL. Lions looked somewhat predictable and jaded. With McCullum yet to find his feet,  Finch has to fire. Dhawan needed a match like this with no real RR pressure to score few runs. Going by his career success rate (1 innings of some substance every 10-12 innings), he may have done his bit for this IPL.

GL batting looks top heavy ( no i am not referring to  the stocky build of Finch or excess weight Raina seems to be carrying ) with a long tail with Jadeja coming at no.5, they should get another Indian batsman , whatever happened to Ishant Kishan who has not played after the first match and was singled out of praise by there coach Brad Hogde .

Poor caotaincy from Warner... By now,  every local and international captain would be knowing the way to restrict Raina... Its not rocket science... If Raina scores thats direct question on captaincy... Otherwise pretty good day for sunrisers

Mustafiz would not be as dangerous when the ball is not gripping but the thought of him bowling 3 overs in the last 5... that will effect the other teams. Raina was middling the ball, still did not go after Mustafiz.  Buzz was playing ok, but not-scoring at one over made him worried. Nehra would be very effective/economical.  They can win the IPL. Their core is so powerful. If they keep Warner, Mustafiz and Nehra they can always build a team around these three.

Resounding win and we are out of the bottom !! As I had commented in the preview, GL has the worst middle order and they got exposed thoroughly. I will be very surprised if they qualify for the knockouts. We had an almost perfect game in all three departments. Still I find it a tad unfair that Ashish Reddy was dropped to bring in Tare. Ashish has performed beyond his capabilities and delivered good performances in all the games so far. Either Dhawan or Ojha should have made way. As predicted Dhawan has shown "form" - but it will not escape the scrutiny of tactical guys like MS that a quality off-spinner can easily shut out this opening combo - which is why Williamson at the top of the order (when he recovers) is an absolute must. Our next match is against Punjab and I am 100% sure that Maxwell will bowl in the power play. I hope our "think tank" comes up with some tactics rather than play formula cricket. Hooda bowling was a welcome change and gives more options. Go SRH !!!

Dhawan, Warner, Kane, Ojha/Tare, Henriques, Yuvraj, Hooda, Bipul/Sran, Nehra, Fizz, Bhuvi are my choice.

Finally, Dhawan due for a decent score.  Yes, he scores a 50 or 100 every 10 matches and now he can twirl his mustache.  The next one will come may be at the fag end of IPL.

Dhawan coming back tosome sort of form is very good for Sunrisers,but it's lame to keep Kane Williamson out, they are heavily reliant on Warnar which is not healthy as per team combination goes. Wonder when would Yuvraj nd Nehra wld be back, that wld make them a lot stronger.Mustafizur, mate pls keep up your good work and continue to make us proud.

Just shows that GL were winning mostly because of Aaron finch and his failure exposed thier fragile batting.Karthik, bravo and jadeja have not really done much with the bat of late. Dale steyn should have completed his quota of overs. Picking him and just giving him two overs is poor captaincy. He should have been relied upon to give a breakthrough considering the small target

I like the nickname Alan Wilkins gives mustafizur, the magician. Inform Warner, shikhar getting form and the duo of bhuvi and mustafizur make SRH a tough unit to beat.

Though Buvhi has taken a four for but it was Mustafiz who has controlled the middle and end overs from which Gujarat Lions couldn't come across to post a huge total. Hats off to the cutter master, Mustafiz; what a lovely bowler BD has produced!

Gujarath's over dependency on Finch is exposed . SRH is gelling up as a team very well.Dhawan ATLAST scored 50 .. but it is evident he is out of form .
Replace Sran with Boult , Henriques with Yuvi , Bipul with Nehra bang !!!

Resounding win and we are out of the bottom !! As I had commented in the preview, GL has the worst middle order and they got exposed thoroughly. I will be very surprised if they qualify for the knockouts. We had an almost perfect game in all three departments. Still I find it a tad unfair that Ashish Reddy was dropped to bring in Tare. Ashish has performed beyond his capabilities and delivered good performances in all the games so far. Either Dhawan or Ojha should have made way. As predicted Dhawan has shown "form" - but it will not escape the scrutiny of tactical guys like MS that a quality off-spinner can easily shut out this opening combo - which is why Williamson at the top of the order (when he recovers) is an absolute must. Our next match is against Punjab and I am 100% sure that Maxwell will bowl in the power play. I hope our "think tank" comes up with some tactics rather than play formula cricket. Hooda bowling was a welcome change and gives more options. Go SRH !!!

Dhawan, Warner, Kane, Ojha/Tare, Henriques, Yuvraj, Hooda, Bipul/Sran, Nehra, Fizz, Bhuvi are my choice.  
</p>
<p>
Henriques can be replaced with Morgan in case Sran is playing.

Inclusion of Ashish Nehra and Yuvi will make SRH look more formidable and Yes, only after they return, SRH can bring Kane in the playing 11.

It was vintage SRH! Restricting teams to low totals and chasing them down. The team had a poor start to the season but it appears to have gained some confidence. Great. Now that they have some momentum, lets see how they fare till game 7. Certainly the return of Nehra, Yuvraj, and Kane will fortify them. Dhawan finally scored some runs but it is of no use if he is one match wonder. Their weak areas are middle and lower order, they lack good spin options. Will be wonderful to watch if they field below team:
</p>

SRH Best XI: 1 Warner 2 Dhawan 3 Kane 4 Ojha 5 Morgan 6 Yuvraj 7 Hooda 8 Bhuvi 9 Nehra 10 Mustafizur 11 Sran

Good show by David-Dhawan duo. and bowlers particularly Bhuvi and Fiz. Poor tacktics by Lions to not have a prope right arm offf spinner to counter to two lefties in the middle. Hope they learn

Mustafizur, the Fizz and the Magician.....
</p>
<p>
AND to me is the silent killer who takes the game away from opposition before even they realize. 
</p>
<p>
Fizz also helped other bowlers to get wickets because of his tight bowling in one end.
</p>
<p>
 It does not matter weather he gets wicket or not but still exciting to watch his each and every ball he delivers.  
</p>
<p>
SRH got very good bowling unit this year, once Nehra is back it will be even stronger.

Finally, Dhawan due for a decent score.  Yes, he scores a 50 or 100 every 10 matches and now he can twirl his mustache.  The next one will come may be at the fag end of IPL.

Dhawan coming back tosome sort of form is very good for Sunrisers,but it's lame to keep Kane Williamson out, they are heavily reliant on Warnar which is not healthy as per team combination goes. Wonder when would Yuvraj nd Nehra wld be back, that wld make them a lot stronger.Mustafizur, mate pls keep up your good work and continue to make us proud.

Just shows that GL were winning mostly because of Aaron finch and his failure exposed thier fragile batting.Karthik, bravo and jadeja have not really done much with the bat of late. Dale steyn should have completed his quota of overs. Picking him and just giving him two overs is poor captaincy. He should have been relied upon to give a breakthrough considering the small target

I like the nickname Alan Wilkins gives mustafizur, the magician. Inform Warner, shikhar getting form and the duo of bhuvi and mustafizur make SRH a tough unit to beat.

Though Buvhi has taken a four for but it was Mustafiz who has controlled the middle and end overs from which Gujarat Lions couldn't come across to post a huge total. Hats off to the cutter master, Mustafiz; what a lovely bowler BD has produced!

Another one sided game. The IPL appears to be losing its lustre this season. Are those empty seats one keeps seeing in the Stadiums?

Gujarath's over dependency on Finch is exposed . SRH is gelling up as a team very well.Dhawan ATLAST scored 50 .. but it is evident he is out of form .
Replace Sran with Boult , Henriques with Yuvi , Bipul with Nehra bang !!!

As I had commented in the preview, GL has the worst middle order and they got exposed thoroughly. I will be very surprised if they qualify for the knockouts. We had an almost perfect game in all three departments. Still I find it a tad unfair that Ashish Reddy was dropped to bring in Tare. Ashish has performed beyond his capabilities and delivered good performances in all the games so far. Either Dhawan or Ojha should have made way. As predicted Dhawan has shown "form" - but it will not escape the scrutiny of tactical guys like MS that a quality off-spinner can easily shut out this opening combo - which is why Williamson at the top of the order (when he recovers) is an absolute must. Our next match is against Punjab and I am 100% sure that Maxwell will bowl in the power play. I hope our "think tank" comes up with some tactics rather than play formula cricket. Hooda bowling was a welcome change and gives more options. Go SRH !!!\n</p>\n</p>'b'<p>\nResounding win and we are out of the bottom !!

Had Kulkarni taken one or two early wickets, the pressure would have been right back on SRH and jadeja could then have build upon the pressure.\n</p>'b'<p>\n<p>\nthe latest short format is in now it is 5mins duration match called "TOSS"..\n</p>\n</p>'b'<p>\nthe latest short format is in now it is 5mins duration match called "TOSS"..\n</p>'b'<p>\n<p>\nThere shud be only one way going by these matches.The home teams shud bat first,and bowl first away if this is d trend.Every match is decided at d toss.RCB seem like the only team who can put up a half decent score batting first.\n</p>\n</p>'b'<p>\nThere shud be only one way going by these matches.The home teams shud bat first,and bowl first away if this is d trend.Every match is decided at d toss.RCB seem like the only team who can put up a half decent score batting first.\n</p>'b"<p>\n<p>\nBad captaincy from Raina. He should have started with Kulkarni instead of Praveen Kumar. With such a low score on board, Tambe and Bravo should bowl atleast 2 overs each in first 10 overs of the innings.

SRH is like Paki team, you never know which team turns up on a given day .very unpredictable. But I think the main reason for their superb performances last two matches including this is Fizz in bowling and Warner in batting. The kind of confidence that Fizz gives to the bowling side , any team can win , well if they bat well. SRH will win if they score quickly during those first 6 overs, well wicket of Dhawan will be lost in 1st over of course,and I never count him as a player in XI , its upon the other 10 players to get this team over the mark.\n</p>\n</p>'b'<p>\nTricky chase this for SRH.

This is what happened vs MI and I think this is going on in warners mind too.If they can successfully do it SRH can win this game. Dhawan is a walking wicket anyways, wonder who will kick him out .may be he himself needs to do it.\n</p>\n</p>'b'<p>\nIf SRH can quietly get through until 15 over, then Fizz can come and run his show.
