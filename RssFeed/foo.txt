Good decision by the BCB. Actions have consequences and people like Shahadat needs to know that. Forget about the national side, he should never be allowed to take part in the domestic league.

I think if Bangladesh can get over their India fascination, they can perhaps make it big later on...To be still stuck on India- pretty childish IMO. In the past the team has also beaten RSA, SRL, Aus NZ and Pak, why not talk about them ?

The worse thing about losing like that is ,it will haunt the players involved and the fans for a long long time. But Mahmudullah has won many matches for BD recently and should try to get over this. Mushfiq on the other hand is done and dusted. He seems to have lost his skills, can't handle pressure, and his now infamous celebration before the game ended has left a permanent scar on BD.

Com'on Mahmudullah, its alright. India gave your team quite a few chances that could have helped you but you didn't capitalize. The most fearsome and devastating opener of all time Tamim Iqbal got 2 chances yet couldn't last long 10 overs. The best you can do is sit at home watch matches and hope India loses. Then express 'this is happiness' on twitter like our Mushfiqur.

Seriously, these losses are heart-breaking.  India had its own share, still remember Miandad hitting Chetan Sharma for a six the last ball in an ODI in Sharhah.

Mushfiq went for glory and perished pathetically. Dulla did not learn a lesson from it while watching from the other end. He then tried to do even better than Musfiq and perished even more pathetically. Rest was history and it will torment them for years to come. There will be no second time Dulla. You will have to live with that sinking feeling.

It took that long to admit? Mahmudullah's approach at chasing has always been slow. We lost the Asia Cup final to Pakistan and again almost lost the match against Pakistan this Asia Cup due to Mahmudullah's slow approach. Thanks to those no balls from Sami we won. Mahmudullah is a fine player. Though he always appeared to me as a top order and not a finisher. Coach thinks his best players should finish the match. Well, if your best players come in to bat after so many wickets fell, they will play defensive (under pressure) and there is no room for dot balls in T20s. Most teams play their best players up front. To me, the best players we have in stock for T20s are (in this order): Tamim, Anamul, Sabbir, Mahmudullah, Shakib, Mushfiq. Batting order is very important.

All of you are very emotional and have very short memory. I would like to point out few key points that you guys should keep in mind before commenting.
1. It does not matter what BD fans claim, they are obviously less mature than India.
2. BD started seeing success in home ground which is a good sign so the India was once tiger at home but cat at abroad. Even still they get beaten in Eng/Aus 4-0 or 5-0 in test.
3. Remember Ashween Tweeted before Oman VS BD game that if BD win than 1 country will be happy but if Oman win whole world will be happy, But no one condemn or criticized him.
4. It is just recently BD started seeing the success and therefore, their fans will be excited until they get used to it and as a matured fans people should consider this.
5. At the and of the day its a great news that we are going to have another (hopefully)strong country in cricket in Asia which will bring more excitement and good cricketers in cricket.
Thanks

The margin of defeat for Bangladesh was the smallest it can be in a run chase. A mis-field here, an extra there hitting the ball on a marginally different trajectory and there would be a different story. Mahmudullah nor Mushfiqur Rahim need not take the sole blame for the loss.

Yes, all his fault and about time Muddles takes the blame for it. He is the real deal. Besides, the Bangles were just not good enough. They did not win anything in the World T20, right? They should be demoted and Afghanistan be promoted or something. After playing in the little leagues, maybe they will come to par and beat other awful teams like the Saffers.

Seriously! Fact is India won Bangladesh lost. This is an article about a Banladeshi player taking responsibility and talking humbly. I commend Mahmudullah for this. He didn't have to do it, but we know how humble of a person he is. I appreciate his courage and gentle words. All he deserves is our support and appreciation. I have no Idea why some indian fans are even posting messages here. If they must post a message , they can try not to be o distasteful, so much hatred, this will never make you a better team. A better team will win games on the field. In this occasion, India was a better team. When India lost a series in Bangldesh , Bangladesh was a better team. We look forward to the future and enjoy cricket and let the better teams make statements by winning games. Peace...

This message should have come from Mushfiqur and not Mahmudullah. Mahmudullah being the greater person, took up this blame on himself, and that shows the strength of his character. Mushfiqur who was the Captain of this BD team has still not matured inspite of all his experience. If there are a few more players with the character and maturity like Mahmudullah, BD indeed will reach great heights. But players as shallow as Mushfiqur will surely cause the downfall of such a talented bunch of players  Cheers!

Anyway, if there is a similar situation - I would be relying on Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur again. Both are match winners.

BAN have caught up with PAK and SL in the shorter formats, for two reasons, an ascendant BAN and a weakened SL and PAK. The series loss by IND against BD and the near loss in the T20 has shown how close BAN are getting to IND. Dhoti boasted in the tournament that his team does not feel pressure. The pressure of losing to BAN in India was tremendous. That combined with Mashrafes tactical planning nearly had the better of them. Obviously India were found out further down the line when WI totally silenced the IND fans. Gloat and pinch all you want, but know this, these games will become closer and more pressurised for both sides.

He should not only admits the faults but also feel sorry for his country. It was easy task to take singles. And all four batsman ( He, Musfiq, Mustafiz and Shuvagoto) are responsible for this loss. I still dont understand why Mustafiz did not start running just after the bowling???? strange??? why he came out with Helmet while he was in the non striker end?? these all are big big mistake. People are blaming rightly to them.

As the best batsman in Bangladesh, it was really his responsibility. Can't leave it for the immature mushfiqur.
However, Mahmudullah is going to leave his mark on the game. All the best.

Bangladesh lost through stupidity rather than anything else. It is the second time that Mushfiqur Rahim was in this similar situation, the first time was few years back against Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe. He then went for a six when Bangladesh only needed a single run to win. Anyhow we need to learn from this and move on. One point where I disagree with Mahmudullah Riad is one should take up the full responsibility and finish the job rather then rely on others.

Bangladesh is simply not good enough as some have pointed out. They must learn how to win games from teams like the West Indies who scored 24 runs in the last over of the World Cup final. Bangladesh choked even when only 2 runs were needed in 3 balls with plenty of wickets in hand. And their batsmen got out to two consecutive full tosses. It has taken three weeks after the defeat for Mahmudullah to realize they could have tried for a couple of singles. Even college and club cricketers would know that. It only shows that they are not exactly fast learners.

@THECOWCORNER  IPL has not given India anything and we all know what Pandya did apart from that last over against BD and some good fielding. Nothing! really ordinary he was and that's IPL for you . And yes you're right that in your lifetime you won't see BD playing in AUS, ENG, SA, NZ because they are simply not good enough and are still minnows in Tests and T20s. Now what about BPL?

BD needs to stop hating IND and focus on improving in all formats. Mustafizur and Nehra are showing sportsmanship, the fans can learn from them to be humble. WI are WC champions so all this nonsense about a group game is irrelevant.

Some of you Indian fans who are going over the top with your Bangla-hate need to stop being so emotional and calm down. Let's just enjoy the drama of cricket and learn to respect people of all countries. This is cricket, not war. Stop being so childishly defensive about your team. Great players like MSD and Virat don't need you keyboard warriors to defend them: they are objectively cricketing greats already. And trying to defend your "honour" by denigrating the opposition is just in poor taste.

@Facebook User it wasnt choke mate it was stupidity, it was complacency, I would've called this a choking had they required 6/7 of 3, which is getable but reqiured calm execution. And m not telling who won or lost, I just told what went wrong with last three ball. Yes what Rahim tweeted was childish, even BAN fan protested his immaturity, and BCB aslo aaked him for an explanation. @GR8 ipl is in 9th edition wherease it was just 3rd for bpl, besides numbers of the games is aslo a huge difference so does the number of top foreign players involves

Also, definition for choked..(in sports) fail to perform at a crucial point of a game or contest owing to a failure of nerve. Pretty much looks like what bd did.

The cow corner. I guess the best thing is you can say you almost beat India. Fact is that you choked, or in other words you were not good enough. True, India was not good enough in the semifinals, we get that. But, because of the vitriol you guys spray even when India loses against any team, not just yours, makes this win against bd very satisfying. May I say, the sad faces of the bd team was fun to watch, as was mushfiqur rahim 's quick and silly apology after his schoolboy tweet after the semis. Bye now, and keep losing.

But, because of the vitriol you guys spray even when India loses against any team, not just yours, makes this win against bd very satisfying. May I say, the sad faces of the bd team was fun to watch, as was mushfiqur rahim 's quick and silly apology after his schoolboy tweet after the semis. Bye now, and keep losing.

@GR8GAUR so you don't count the ipl experience? Any explanation to this? Check your players how many t20 they played, you are only talking about t20I not t20s together. Regarding playing with the top teams we would only dream playing Aus, Eng, SA, Nz etc in their backyard. I don't think I would see us playing them in their condition in my lifetime.

@THECOWCORNER LOL! Exams were over 3 years ago, so no stress and heat doesn't affect me in April. Now that you resort to IPL, you've seen it's doing more harm to India than good. Losing to SA in ODIs and T20s and then to WI in semis. Simmons said in post match interview how his IPL experienced helped him even with no practice and jet lag that he carried. Its not you who said Rohit's chance was bad luck, I'm talking about BD fans here. In such a short time, they have created quite a buzz you see. Finally, BD got its own BPL as well much to your deliberate ignorance.

@THECOWCORNER As for your logic that we often play against big teams, IND-73 T20s compared to BD-62. What a vast difference in terms of experience really! ratio of almost 7:6, huh? India comes last among top 8 in terms of T20 experience buddy. Now who's got the excuse? Talk facts for once.

@GR8GAUR I feel you are upset my friend, what is it? exam, stress or heat? you got all my facts wrong. I meant toss should not be an excuse, there are many example BAN lose as they lost the tosses, in fact it is none of our hand so should not be an excuse. Did I say Shakib Dropped Rohit was a bad luck for BAN?mind to check what I wrote again? And regarding number of the matches dont forget your play countless matches in ipl,  with words top players, dont forget what Dhoni said, your team is in auto pilot mode meaning every one is experienced enough to handle his role courtesy ipl.

@THECOWCORNER Did I say India never won the toss or you seem just too eager? India lost the toss 4 times out of 5 against NZ, AUS, BD and WI, yet they won 3 out of 5 games played. NZ were on a winning spree as long as they kept winning tosses and even though they lost the toss against ENG they were put to bat which they did whole tournament and they lost. WI never lost the toss and the one match they lost was because of complacency. And yes exactly! if we drop catches we aren't skilled enough but if Shakib drops Rohit Sharma then INDIA WAS LUCKY!  Double standard at best. And yes India plays more T20s than BD but compared to other, you need to check the number of T20s India played, we are at 6 or 7th in number of total matches that too when 17-18 games were played in just last 6 months. Talking of experience and skills, it teaches that you should not celebrate until you finish the game and example is in form of Mushfiqur. Ever seen Dhoni, Kohli celebrating before last run is scored

Funny to see some of you are telling about drop chances, you drop means you are not skilled enough hence deserve to lose. the same way Shakib dropped Rohit in Asia cup and they deserved to lose for dropping a player like Rohit who went onto score big that ultimately decided a India win.

It was one of the worst limited over games India had played in a long time.  It doesn't happen often, not in their home conditions anyways, but India choked badly for the most part of the 39.3 overs. The potential embarrassment of losing against BD in the WC knockout in home conditions showed in their approach from the start. But their relief Dhoni found a way to hold it together long enough for BD to choke and fold instead. I understand this must hurt badly, because there is a toxic resentment against India among BD players, cricket establishment, media and fans. May be Mahmudullah can take the Mushfiquir route and find joy and redemption by celebrating India's loss against the WI.

@GR8GAUR as if India never won a toss, is it my friend? the difference between class acts like Dhoni, Virat and mediocre ones like Mushfiqur, Mahmullah are actually number of t20 game India players played. you guys play big teams often both home and away, countless matches in ipl, so you should possess more experience and skill isnt it?

the culprit in order was Mahmudullah&gt; Hom&gt; Rahim. It was Rahim who hit consecutive boundaries to ease the equation, so it was okay he was caught next ball with the adrenalin  went on that moment. But as a set and inform bat what Mahmudullah did next ball is pure complacency, lack of experience, overconfidence, childish and unforgivable. Come to the next ball what Hom did was a slap to his selection in the team and to the entire nation, he even didnt move for seconds after he failed to connect the ball where the aim should have been to anyway connect the ball and run ruthlessly.

I'd say it was also Indian fielders' fault that they dropped so many catches and let the match come so close and Dhoni bowling toothless Pandya ahead of Ash.

No offense but most of the India fans I learned are simply not willing accept defeats, the reason they come up with silly explanation. First of all BAN showed no arrogance, right from the ball one they were in the game, if they were arrogant they would have been reluctant on the field. Second they were not chocked, there were no pressure when the equation came down to 2 off 3, I would suggest you guys to check what choke actually means, they were actually complacent as Mahmudullah said "Not for once did we think we wouldn't win when we needed two runs off three balls with myself and Mushfiqur at the crease". That thinking was the culprit, it is never finish unless it is finished.

No player has to individually bear the loss of such a close game. I think it comes down to how relatively inexperienced Bangladesh are in cricket. Dhoni and the Indian team in general have been in these situations so many times in the past against much more superior teams, and have quite successfully pulled off many heists. The lack of composure in such situations came to haunt Bangladesh on that fateful day. The good this is they'll learn from this. I saw the Fizz bowling in Bangalore yesterday. He's pretty good in the sub-continent. But Bangladesh need more like him and Mahmudullah. Right now, they'll have to hope for an amazingly good day to beat some of the top teams. I mean India dropped like 3-4 catches, and they still fell short of 14-odd runs. Shows the amount high-risk cricket Bangladesh were playing under the guise of 'attacking cricket'.

I know the reason, recent success has gone into your heads but what you don't realize is that all those successes were in your own backyard. You were winless in 2014 and you were winless in 2016 edition as well justifying why you were made to play qualifying rounds with minnows. Had India been chasing 147, they would have achieved it by 18 over at max. 4 chances dropped, costly misfields, losing the toss, BD requiring 52 off last 8 overs @6.5 rpo with 6 wickets in hand batting deep till number 9 and if it still goes down to last over, then we know how mediocre the team is. India required 39 off 18 and they finished with 5 balls to spare against Aussies.

WT20 ended on 3rd April and it took this guy 10 days to realize it was his fault. The match was on 23rd March so considering that, its 20 days after he realizes that he choked. That's the difference between class acts like Dhoni, Virat and mediocre ones like Mushfiqur (his premature celebration still makes me laugh) and Mahmudullah who can do it only once in a blue moon but not on a consistent basis.

@MOH RAHMAN thanks for the explanation. We usually do not see what happens internally. As Mash will retire soon; may be after CT, so BD needs another quick bowler soon. Rony was good in BPL. But still did not show any improvement in international arena. If Rubel is out of the question selectors should look at U19 team. There was one promising pacer in the team showed some good bowling during u19 tournament. Hope to see few changes in BD team soon.

@MANIK_MIA: Rubel was injured and advised to follow the rehabilitation programme. But he neglected the programme and did not follow many steps advised to him, hence BCB asked him for an explanation. As a result of that, BCB decided not to award him a contract. BCB does look after their pacers but only if the pacer himself is supportive towards his injuries.

There are few reasons why Bangladesh cricket improved drastically. One is their captaincy, Mashrafe has done a fantastic job and second is their coaching staffs, likes of Streak and Hathurusingha has changed the culture of Bangladesh cricket. Bangladesh is very lucky to have them.

Taskin is lucky to have a coach like Streak. Who else would want to be bothered when he is out of the country on another job? I am so impressed by Streak's motivation and insistence that he be kept in the loop, even when away. This is a man who more than earns his keep. Hats off to you sir.

This person has so nice an action. Along with Mustafizur, he forms a dangerous combination. Will look forward to seeing them in action soon in the coming days...

I want to forget what really happen in the recent past. Just Want to see him quickly in the international Cricket. ICC should not ban any player during the tournament. New law should be implemented. They can do it if they want but before the tournament.

@MOH RAHMAN thanks for the explanation. We usually do not see what happens internally. As Mash will retire soon; may be after CT, so BD needs another quick bowler soon. Rony was good in BPL. But still did not show any improvement in international arena. If Rubel is out of the question selectors should look at U19 team. There was one promising pacer in the team showed some good bowling during u19 tournament. Hope to see few changes in BD team soon.

@MANIK_MIA: Rubel was injured and advised to follow the rehabilitation programme. But he neglected the programme and did not follow many steps advised to him, hence BCB asked him for an explanation. As a result of that, BCB decided not to award him a contract. BCB does look after their pacers but only if the pacer himself is supportive towards his injuries.

There are few reasons why Bangladesh cricket improved drastically. One is their captaincy, Mashrafe has done a fantastic job and second is their coaching staffs, likes of Streak and Hathurusingha has changed the culture of Bangladesh cricket. Bangladesh is very lucky to have them.

If you scrutinize 90% of the bowlers have problem with few deliveries. Why only TASKIN??

I am not sure what happened to Rubel. He did not even get BD contract for 2016. Can you imagine their star player of WC2015 is missing out? BD did never take care of their pace bowlers. When they get a new prospect on Taskin and Mustafiz, they just forgot about Rubel, Shafiul etc.

Checked out his action on Youtube. Most of his deliveries looked fine. Good potential. Get rid of the dubious ones, and BD have a fine bowling prospect.

I really feel sorry for these 2 players. Their board did let them down.
Their actions should actually have been caught domestically and corrected as soon as they're found. 
That would have avoided such a heart-breaking scenario for the 2 players and the BD team as a whole.
BD fans need to ask their cricket authorities on what preventive measures (to avoid future corrective measures) will they be taking.
Looks like Taskin's corrective measures should be sufficient. Hope, Sunny gets back soon as well.

If the bowling coach accepts that there is a problem with Taskin, then all the hoarse crying by Bangladesh is totally unfounded.

If only some of his slower bouncers were illegal, why he could not continue bowling without those slower bouncers. Why he was banned? Can ICC clarify this?

So now they accept his action is illegal. But I wonder no wonder why not a single Bangladeshi fan raised voice for Sunny. His action was as dodgy at it gets. I think everyone in Bangladesh knew that but they kept him in the team. This is where the problem lies. Many countries do not check the action of bowlers in domestic circuit. That's why their bowler are caught by ICC. If they have a committee which can check the bowling actions at an early stage, they will not be ashamed at world stage.

So in a way everybody accepts that there is a problem...If a bowler bowls one Illegal delivery or 10 it doesn't matter, the bowler needs to rectify the action and come back. Sometimes it's better to introspect rather than blaming others for each and everything that is wrong with BCB. Huge talent in Bangladesh team but serious problems with the way BCB is handling things. On a different note, the reason why everybody is all praise about Afghans is the way they have improved in just few years versus so many years of mediocre cricket. Be rational and appreciate what others are achieving rather than self boasting.

"Taskin Ahmeds action can be remedied quickly" well well, did Heath just admit that there is something after all that requires some remedial action ? What will happen to all the conspiracy theories then ? Well, anyways good to hear that. Taskin is a fine young prospect and deserves to have a long run in international cricket, albeit in a remedied action.

He is definitely a promising player and a good prospect for the future. He is almost as good as anyone we have now in the subcontinent. The sooner he gets back to the otherwise ordinary side, the better it is for his side and of course cricket.

BD lost it because of lack of respect for opponents. BD is an improved team alright, but beating the top 6 will take atleast another 5-6 years... 
Team has dead weight like Al Amin, Mushfiqur, Mithun Ali,  Shuvagata, Sowma Sarkar who are eating up talents of Mustafizur, Sakib, Sabbir etc...
On the other side see Afganistan, they brought a new brand of fearless cricket and really wining hearts of cricket lovers. I would not be surprised if Afgans get ODI status in another 4-5 years...

Apart from all the suggestions, I want to point out the fragile condition of BD's opening(batting) pair. We do not have an useful partner with Tamim Iqbal. Sommo was playing well in one day matches but flopped in T 20's.  Our team can not afford  the pressure of Tamim's early out. This is not a matured sign.We need a consistent opening partner with Tamim. It could be Imrul Kayes due to his cool attitude where Tamim is aggresaive.

Requesting to do home work after before deploying your team in field - pitch is so slow but your team trying to return back home as early with playing hard.

<p>
2nd thing- team players are not consulting each other in field- specially in batting - how they should bat situation wise- if they do so , result of India -bangladesh match might be different.  You might see indian team members was consulting each others in field. why not we?
</p>
<p>
3rd, your team members should not be so emotional  - two players have gone and one match lost so closely- should not be any matter for any professional team. see we lost 75 runs at last match - means effect on IND-BD match.

The biggest problem was batting order wasn't stable at all, its very hard for the batsmen to perform if their position is changing again and again. Another thing was we had a mentality that are weak in t20's...That's a psychological barrier that we could not defeat. Mithun's inclusion, Soumya's middle order position, not using an amazing keeper like Nurul was a downside from strategic perspective. Tamim-Imrul partnership has a good historic background, they enjoy themselves at any format of the game, we should use that in each and every format.

The biggest problem was batting order wasn't stable at all, its very hard for the batsmen to perform if their position is changing again and again. Another thing was we had a mentality that are weak in t20's...That's a psychological barrier that we could not defeat. Mithun's inclusion, Soumya's middle order position, not using an amazing keeper like Nurul was a downside from strategic perspective. Tamim-Imrul partnership has a good historic background, they enjoy themselves at any format of the game, we should use that in each and every format.

Excellent analysis Haturasinghe.. BD cricket owe a lot to this man. Our batsmen will have to mature a bit more. Its not far bowlers like Mustafiz , AlAmin will start to get wickets in test cricket as well. BD does not have a world class spinner as well. Sakib is good, his effectiveness is limited to right hand batsmen, specially when they try to attack him. We need a leg spinner or an offspinner to go with the quicks. BD bowling would be more threatening, if a spinner could go with Mustafiz, AlAmin and Taskin.

@NP_NY:  on par with Afghanistan?  I am sure you meant on Par with India, as they have scored 70 against NZ (to compare with India's 79 against the same team), and scored 1 run less than India did when they played each other, that looks on par to me, unless you really think Afghanistan can also give India a run for their money like BD did, in that case your statement is absolutely correct!

Bangladesh have improved but not as much as everyone is saying. They are good at home but the slightest difficulty in the pitch and they become an average side. Let's see them abroad and see how they perform. The only game in this world cup where they have played well was against India which they should have won. Other than that they have  been abysmal. One decent performance out of four does not make u a good side

Bangladesh has improved a lot , they are much better than current pak and sl teams , today's game though it felt like they've given up right from the start of their batting innings , are they emotionally too sunk with their loss to India ? You're playing for ur country for god sake .if you're not mentally strong expect no sympathies ...you'll be trashed ruthlessly...like NZ did today

Bangladesh bowling has improved? Not true. BD's spin bowling has deteriorated significantly over the last year or so. They have one good medium fast bowler - Mustafizur - whose cutters are difficult to read for now, but it's only a matter of time before batsmen figure him out (like they did Ajanta Mendis). BD's batting is not even on par with Afghanistan. The only good thing they have going for them is good coaching staff.

Nasir snub still remains a mystery. Its either, "selectors want him in team, but coach does not". Or "Coach and selectors want him in team but some outside force is against that". Mithun and Shuvagoto deserved a chance. They were given the chances. But I think it was proven they are not International quality. Saqlain Shazib only played one game. He did not look too special. But I guess it will not be fair to pass judgement from one performance. Only good thing to take away from last 2 games, Soumya got some runs down the order.

With 70 all out and 0-4 result, BD showed that their minnows status in world cricket and why they aren't taken seriously. Some BD fans ridiculing NZ as their fav team to beat is hilarious. Alarmingly, SL too is going downhill to claim minnows status. Time to give BD test status to Afg and Ireland.

BAN team, learn from Kohli and Dhoni. They delivered and never celebrated as if they won the World Cup. Cool level headed cricketers. These are called the Champions, not the ones that thump their chest. Stand and deliver first. BAN team and fans, you will never earn the respect of other countries until you respect. BAN wll never see such an inning (like the one that Kohli played today), played by any of  their  players. Now we know who are the real tigers and who are paper tigers.

I would like to say all these cricket lovers here that BD are still improving and playing some good cricket too. They still need to learn a lot but i don't think our players our overburdened by our supporters. I think it's a common thing in our sub continent. It happens more in India and Pakistan. last year when India lost to BD Indian supporters went crazy. Look at Pakistan now. Everyone in Pakistan now wants Afridi to go and a complete change to the team. It's true some supporters expect just too much and some are like bad apples. At the end of the day it's just sports. We are here for some entertainment

With Afghanistan winning against one of the best team of the tournament Bangladesh is the only team without a single win. Honestly I see good potential in Afghanistan due to their super athleticism and physique. But still I can't say they are better than WI.The point is the Bangla fans start cheering their side on just few home wins to the point they become careless and rude on established Asian sides. Whether Its Pakistan or Srilanka they are great sides and this is just a slump in form due to different factors. But they have produced world class cricketers and in few years they will be competing for the top slot again. Bangladesh and Afghanistan are up and coming sides and they have to prove a lot. Bangladesh was on the brink a few years back despite ICC investment and its very encouraging now that they are showing signs of improvement.

@Sammy, Nuraizsarfraz, you guys and your team will get respect of fans from other countries if you stop claiming that your team is the best (although they are really good now) and learn to respect other teams. Don't throw silly excuses (Taskin being out of the team or injury to Mustafizur or whatever), don't bring frivolous arguments like the size of population of a country, how long they have had test status etc. Such arguments will neither win matches for your team and nor will win arguments for you, but will get plenty of hate. First thing you have got to do is stop that line.

BD fans are their teams worst enemy. Every one in India is disgusted by their kiddish yakking. So much so, that the whole stadium of Indians was cheering for Pakistan in their match against BD. Every BD fan including this BD writer gives excuses of Bad Luck. Therein lies the problem: if the whole of BD incl their team relies only on luck, they will always be minnows. Hard work - not luck - makes one great. But then i guess, blaming bad luck is a culture thing for the banglas. Anyway, good luck to them.

@CRICLOVERBD2016 Good on you for being so passionate about the game and your team. But you keep referring to needing nurturing and support from outside to help BD improve and grow. I am all for it. However there are several Associates (Afghans, Dutch, Irish and even UAE) that are far more deserving and competitive than BD. In fact BD would probably be last on that list. So by all means support your team all you want, just don't expect any sympathy from others. Your team needs it's fans like you, whether it deserves them is a different story. Also, call your team what you like. It's a sad but true reality that Tigers have been losing out, just like the BD team, for a long time now (due to over population and loss of habitat), so it's probably appropriate.

Mustafizur doesn't deserve the Player of the Match. He cleaned up the tail only! HM Nichols (Opener), KS Williamson (Opener), GD Elliott (Middle Order), 3 wickets of his 5 wickets were top order &amp; middle order. 
You know what? I really respect the fans of NZ &amp; SA, it's because I don't see them commenting anything odd like some odd fans from this Subcontinent (BD, Ind, Pak, SL, Afg). Please give the credit where it deserves to go. Thanks anyway.

White wash, bangla wash, series wins against pak, india, SA, Zim all happened on home grounds. BD has been playing and winning on home grounds. once they came out they are exposed, have lost all four matches. they should go out and play in other countries, playing in BD and just maintaining the ranking will not improve their abilities.

BD players should forget this WC as a bad dream &amp; move on with positive intent. There is no scarcity of talent. It needs to be channelized though. The players need to stay away from the chaos surrounding them &amp; focus solely on getting the processes right. 
</p>
<p>
For the fans, please give your players some breathing space. Don't put them in a pressure cooker situation in every other game. IT'S JUST A GAME!!

BD are becoming a very good limited overs team but the high expectations from the fans and local media are having telling effect on the teams performance.Some of the new players are also very good like Sabbir and Somya.Lets  follow their future and best wishes from India

I feel sorry for the tigers. What a humiliating defeat in the hands of the same Kiwis who are just white- washed (called Bangla Wash) by declaring the intent a priori at home!! This huge defeat of Bangladesh by 75 runs in aT20 match surely does not tell us the story that Bangladesh is so novice compared to NZ. It appears that a few factors have caused this lowest total. First, the batters looked mentally and physically so exhausted, may be after these three defeats in a row, that their mind was not in the game but somewhere else. And it appeared to us that they were in a hurry to catch the plane to go home.  Second, we have been noticing that Bangladesh batting lately has become totally dependent on Tamim's or Shabbir's performance.  It is still a mystery to us why Tamim had to be so callous and catch a stomach flue staying in a five-star hotel. And he even had to miss the vital Australian meet.  Third, the tigers must improve their physical strength and fitness to stay in the business

Bangla players are tiny n weak. They can not sustain their performance, they need to work hard n maybe come back 100-120 years?  Beating associates is one thing n playing against major teams is other

That Taskin and Sunny issue has derailed Bangladesh's concentration on the competition. Mustafiz's injury also made it difficult at the super 10 stage. A full strength Bangladesh was needed to win against these top teams. We lost Taskin and Sunny, and then Mustafiz and Tamim in some matches. Being emotional also did not help. The matches against Australia and India should have been won. If that were achieved I am sure we would not have collapsed against our favorite opponent, New Zealand as well.

Every Run. Who was the Runner up in the Asia Cup last month? Didn't Bandgladesh beat both SLanka and Pakistan at the Asia Cup? Where was Afghanistan? We have won series against Pakistan, India and South Africa in 2015. If this is not the sign of strength then what is? We lost to India by ONE run only the other day.

Time to give Bangladesh's test status to Afghanistan. Let's develop Afghanistan cricket. Providing test status to Bangladesh was a poor investment. They can never improve!!!!

There is a little bit knowledge for u guys . mustafiz won't be lethal in Australia , England or saf condition.  Because ball will not grip on the surface there which is his primary strength.  He will be hugely successful in subcontinental conditions though .

What BD needs to do as a team are the following: 1. Develop much higher standards of fitness and athleticism than you have now. That'll not only improve your fielding and running between the wickets, but also give you genuine confidence. 2. Develop mind power that enables you to take wise cool-headed decisions in the midst of chaos. You will then be able to do what's right for a situation, and not what your seething testosterone tempts you to do.  3. Cut down the violent aggro a bit. It looks amateurish and exposes your inadequacy and lack of self-belief. Good luck!

Bangla team is getting progress but it is slow not steady. They are nearly unbeatable in home series but away they are so weak. Much need to work for away victories. Mustafizur is the great bowler and he will be lethal in Eng, NZ and Aussie conditions. I hope in coming years   Team will be more strong. Wish them all the best.

My Bangla brothers and sisters, as some of you said - over reaction and getting emotional is in the gene of south asians - Ind, Pak, Nep, SL, Ban and others. One good swing of the bat from Mushfiq or Mahamadullah would've changed the fate and the same Indians who praise MS Dhoni as masterclass would've gone for his throat baying for blood.

You are not doing anything wrong. Keep supporting your team and if possible ignore the haters, after all in the end, its just a game.

It also get me thinking about the mythical spinner from sub continent.
No doubt there there have many great spinners but hasn't this tournament highlighted the obvious? That if the pitch supports spin then suddenly even modest ability is amplified? Harbhajan is being mentioned by fans now. Is it not true that this part of the world makes guys of average ability seem great? Anil Kumble. Don't get me wrong, i respect those guys alot but be honest.
Everyone in your power has been done to get the ball to do crazy things. If it's a muscle fight you get sand kicked in your face.  A muscular frame is required when bowling year in &amp; out to generate pace.
I seriously think Bangladesh need weight gain &amp; muscle strengthening programmes more than they do cricket training. They know the game. The fans love the game. They just need a little more lead in the pencil, so to speak.

@Sammy, yes right BD will win a world cup. They will get some fine players. But BD should realize that they need to play other teams not just india. Of late they seem to target india for all their ails. Pakistan made this mistake and they have gone downhill. Yes it is good to beat india but that should not be the only motivation. Mustafizur is in Ipl so note that india do respect good quality.

IMHO, despite the presence of some very arrogant BD fans on these columns, there are some sensible, reasonable fans out there. These fans deserve our respect. As does the BD team (except Mushfiqur, who I've always thought, lacks a bit in the grey cells count). Bangladesh has reached a level in ODI and T20 cricket whereby no team now takes them lightly.

Another solid, confident win. Great stuff. Mustafizz was really something, but 
NZ looked good all the way. Still haven't seen the kiwis bowl on a truly batsman-friendly pitch yet, which is a slight concern. But by the same token, we haven't seen them bat on one either.

Bangladesh was not expected to win any game in W20  and they proved right . The close match against India was due to  the dropped catches,  that to too many.   Watch out for Afghanistan, it's time we should start appreciating their performances.

The best thing about all this super 10 stage is, contrary to what we told by all the sub continent cricket (cough) experts, New Zealand have beaten Australia, India, Pakistan &amp; Bangladesh, WITHOUT Brendon McCullum, Trent Boult, Tim Southee, Matt Henry.  
We were told Martin Guptil would be shown as a hometrack bully who can't play on slow tracks. That's why the IPL wanted nothing to do with him.
We told New Zealand are imminently beatable. Yet they keep winning.
4 Games 4wins.  This New Zealand has not hit its straps yet. We have an amazing fielding unit that supports its bowlers.  Ish Sodhi &amp; Mitchel Santner have been stars.  MitchMac also class under pressure. I wish NZ we can play the next 2 games to its potential with the bat. So far it's been an outstanding team performance. Go the Blackcaps!

As a NZ fan I'll put my hand up and say that before this tournament  I thought we had no chance of making the semis. This was based on it being in India where we've traditionally struggled, having 3 Asian teams + Australia in our pool and our woeful history in World T20 tournaments. I'm so very pleased they have proven me wrong so emphatically. They've been outstanding, especially bowling and fielding. Great to see the selectors place so much faith in our young spinners and for them to perform so well.

And I also dont see why Mustafizur should be awarded Player of the match. He cleaned up the tail on a surface that was easy to bowl on (as shown by our bowlers). Williamsons 42 runs and brilliant captaincy truly deserves the player of the match award.

As a Tiger fan, I am disappointed that we lost today. But this time we were beaten by a team that everyone else (including India), had lost to.Wish the Indian "Tiger haters" would give us some credit. We brought the best bowler to the tournament - the "Marvelous  Mustafizur" He outshone so many established stars. India's population is almost ten times that of Bd. You have a much larger pool of players to draw from. That we can still go toe to toe with you and many others, deserves some recognition and respect. Anyways, there will be other World Cups and many other matches. Hopefully we will do better next time.

The Aussies are the only team that have really challenged us. I expect to win the semi against England by a big margin because they struggled to beat a very poor Sri Lankan team. Ill say NZ and AUS will advance out of this group. AUS will lose to WI and NZ will beat ENG, which will set up a NZ vs WI Final which hopefully the Kiwis win ;)

To Banglabandhu and all Bangla fans. Please understand all people are saying is Bangla fans need to be bit more modest and acknowledge other teams efforts as well. If your team lost it is usually because the other team played a little better. That is the message here, and that is it. Dont blame luck or dropped catch or the umpire. These things happen with every team. Everyone knows Bangkadesh is a much better team and can cimpete with anyone. You dont have to prove anything to anyone. Just acknoledge good play from other team as well.

@CRICLOVERBD2016: In 1932 BD was a part of India. From that point of view BD also got the test status in 1932. After that in 1947 BD became a part of Pakistan. Therefore, when Pakistan go the test status BD got the test status second time. Finally they were given the test status as a separate nation. So they got test status three times since 1932. India got test status only once. BD after  getting the test status three times  have achieved virtually nothing. On top of that, after today's performance against NZ I have nothing else to say.

The only positive for BD in this cup is Mustafizur. Great wrists to keep bowling offcutters with no change in action. Results of matches were foregone but they could have still won vs lackluster Ind and Aus.

As usual Bangladesh haters keeps on bashing. Carry on, we don't care. Someone says we got test status for 15 over years and what is our achievement. Check the records and find out how long it took India to won a series. The game against NZ is a bad one and we will be back more stronger.

As a BD fan, i am not very satisfied with out performance in the tournament. I believe it will be a learning curve for us specially for the selectors. It is simply because it is not the best squad as we struggled to fill the gap of out of form players. And the team is also depending to much on Tamim, Shakib and Mahmudullah.

I feel bad for Bangladesh fans - first their team's brain freeze against India and now this abject defeat to NZ. 
I can understand why their fans seem shallow - it's not easy being generous and composed when your team has been fighting for scraps since becoming a test nation. I wonder if this world cup performance is considered good back in Bangladesh - just imagine how other countries would react if they lost all their matches in a WC!

I'm looking forward to seeing this Rahman kid down in NZ at the end of the year on early summer decks. Have to get through Amir and PAK first though!

NZ - Favourites to win the world cup.But have to say williamson has won the matches by defending and winning consecutive tosses.Kiwis chasing ability is not tested under pressure conditions.Feel the batting is over dependant on guptill and taylor.Semifinal against strong England batting lineup will be tough.

Yeah he did KW up like a dog's dinner after KW  top scored with 42. To put that into perspective  the top Bangladesh  score- 16... and 9 other people were bowled out in match so...Mentally  this should be more damaging  than indian  game. Nz has had this before aswell in SA when we got rolled for 40 odd... guess what, we took a good look at ourselves, asked really hard questions  about our game and attitude and tried to FIX the short falls. It's not the fact that Bangladesh  lost, its the talk before which makes people jump up and down. Try to be humble and reactions  like this don't happen, as kiwi cricketers are nice lads but some of the public call it how IT IS.

You are changing your mood of supporting BD team, because of BD fans! 
Wait wait... are u a lover of the game? Or a lover of the Fans? 
</p>
<p>
When children start walking for the first time, fall down again &amp; again, but the seniors help them to stand up &amp; walk, seniors never left them alone. In recent time, BD cricket team has started winning regularly, BD fans were waiting for this since a long long time ago. They are very new with this experience, they aren't familiar with this scenario is as like as Aus, Ind, Pak etc. That's where the wildness &amp; mistakes come from. Test Status: Ind - 1932, BD - 2000. Please allow us to make such a long journey, then we will learn the things that you are finding in us now.
</p>
<p>
After BD, India is my 2nd choice in Cricket. But to be honest, I'm just fed up with many Indian fans. That doesn't mean that I will stop supporting Indian Cricket Team. No stupid Indian fan can stop me supporting their team. I'm a lover of the game, not a lover of the fans!

Bangladesh have now had test status for over 15-16 years. But how many test matches, never mind series have they won or even drawn.  I can't think of any ODI triangular tournaments or T20 tournaments that they won either? That is a bad record, something not quite right there with player development. What are your thoughts people?

@BANGLABANDHU: Have you been watching a different tournament? Lowest score in the series, biggest loss by margin, and the lowest in the points table clearly shows that BD's best year has come and gone in a hurry. So stop demanding respect and earn it!

It's tough to come back mentally after a game like BD had against IND, particularly against what seems to be  a very focused NZ unit who are reading conditions well and playing really well as a team unit.
Wonderful bowling by Mustafizur Raman, did KW up like a dog's dinner.

@ NURAIZSARFRAZ ON  MARCH 26, 2016, 17:52 GMT : You said "... the empathetic behaviour of Indians towards you is not because they have become friends now. It's because pak have fallen below sub standard." 
</p>
<p>
We are wondering, if Pakistan is below sub standard, then on which standard BD currently in? Yes, Pakistan's recent performances were disappointing, but still they are far far superior than BD in any given day. To consider the most recent, in WT20 super 10, Pak at least got one thumping victory (that too against BD btw), BD's world beaters achieved 0 win in 4 games ! And let's not bring Test match records, as BD is still laughing stock there in that arena !

"If it (NZ score) would have been 10-15 runs short, the (BD) batters' mindset would have been different" - comments by Mashrafe hilariously summarize BD's present brand of cricket :) all 'If's and 'but's.
Please guys, your game has improved. Improve ur thinking now. Accept what's lacking and develop it rather than blaming every team that beats u. Or else u'll only put up fights and be lost in ur utopia.

Scooby 007 : I like to call spade a spade even if others don't like it. The attitude of fans in SC is the same through out. BD is no exception. We all share same blood same soil same mentality. And the empathetic behaviour of Indians towards you is not because they have become friends now. It's because pak have fallen below sub standard. So its only fitting to show sympathy for the weak.

Feel slightly saddened. Since the first T20, Ind, PK and SL have almost always hit the semis. PK in 2 finals and all 3 teams winning one. A shame that the Asian test nations are good as out. I'm rooting for you, India. Make the SC proud. Let's gel together, SC. Bleed blue, India.

Nuraizsarfraz: Arguably the biggest rivalry in cricket is between PK and India. Go look at the threads and how most of their fans respect the opposition, regardless of result. And then look at your actions for the past few days. You deserve everything thrown at you, now reap what you sow. I was always with BD team and wanted them to do well, you changed me, for now. And, no, I never bragged out my team. You can't say the samething. Big difference. @Tommysaffa: I'm routing for you guys to win. All the best to qualify.

Hmm ... Interesting. This is the evolutions of the critics. Originally the question was " does BD deserve international status". Then it changed to " BD can only beat a team on a bad day". Then after some time the critics line was "can BD win consistently". It's then evolved to " ok they can play consistently but only on home Turf". Now some critics have come about with this new one .... " BD is an improving side but the BD fans are rude and ill mannered". Guess what critics... We'll take it! The super 10s have been enriched because of BD. The elegance of "the Fiz" the tragedy of Taskin, Tamims 100. The greatest T20 in history, the top 2 catches of the tournament from "the cat" soumoya. The BD train rolls on. Our fans are justified in our passion and of course will be offended by insulting TV personalites and commentators who sprinkle their prejudices to the baying public who in turn repeat those insults with greater fervour. Look to yourselves before criticising anybody else.

One thing is for sure. Not using ur best bowlers in grp stages and not chasing the target can hurt nz very much. I admit spinners r playing their part very well bt wat if in k/o stages which i think they will be against eng - they hav to chase down. Eng spiners r also nt that bad nd nz mantra is only to bowl slower through the air so that no pace is generated which allows batman to use his wrist power to generate a power shot. Very bad technique. Plus in finals - i presume indian spinners will web spin shield over them nd rattle their middle order who r yet to be tested while chasing. They shud hav batted second today just for trial. Plus matsufizur bowled very well so it cant be said it was a spinners track. Very bad strategy entering k/o. Winning all 4 in grp stages wont count loosing a single game in k/o stages. Bt a win is a win.  Nd for bd - they now need to blame themselves for such a pathetic display of batting. I mean they cud hav played aggresively nd put pressure on nz bt.....

I have no clue why are people comparing Amir, Mustafiz and Bumrah, they are all 3 different bowlers.Amir is the best new ball bowler, Mustafiz is the best middle overs bowler, whereas Bumrah is the best death overs bowler.Amir however is better in all 3 combined by one bowler.

@CRICLOVERBD2016  Indo Pak fans do not attack and discredit the opposition. It is their own teams they criticise.    
Bangladesh are disrespectful towards the opposition. always blame drop catches   and umpire errors for their losses. they take whinging on umpire  mistakes to another level that England Pak or India cannot match.

I know most of the comments here are influenced by how Bangla fans reacted for other teams.However it was a disappointing campaign but if you can recollect BD are a good ODI side but never were anywhere in tests or T20s (Asia cup finals was because of other teams struggling and home support).Unlucky team was ireland who were denied qualifications due to rain.Anyways all the best for future BD and thank you for coming and entertaining us.

Well,Bangladesh is really a better team now and can no longer be called as minnows and others have to take them seriously.But the problem lies in the fact that their fans are making cricket enthusiasts from other countries to hate them.Your country will be treated based on how you treat them.Agree that you had won against great teams.But it's not valid unless you consistently perform and win on big stages.Be sensible.Lets have a healthy competition and try to support good cricket rather than simply talking bad about the opponents and praising our own teams.

Some people are talking about the reactions of BD fans. Yes, some BD fans like to abuse other teams after a win. I really don't support these type of shameful activities. But there is a real fact, each &amp; every country has those type of fans. We didn't forget about the shameful activities from the Indian fans, Ind vs SL semifinal 1996 world cup. We know about Barmy Army (Eng). Cricket is a gentleman's game, we talk about sportsmanship, but Sledging is a common thing now a days in the cricket field. Pak &amp; Ind fans are well-known as  burner of dummies of the players, even they have attacked player's home many times in the past. But BD fans never did so. Why you people are bashing BD fans if they claim themselves as tiger? What's wrong with you if a BD fan says that we are gonna be world champion?  If I say BD is world champion, does that take any credit away from the real champions? Younger always deserves courage &amp; appreciation from the older, BD fans are really unfortunate in this case.

Some people are talking about the reactions of BD fans. Yes, some BD fans like to abuse other teams after a win. I really don't support these type of shameful activities. But there is a real fact, each &amp; every country has those type of fans. We didn't forget about the shameful activities from the Indian fans, Ind vs SL semifinal 1996 world cup.

BD will not say they would have won if taskin and sunny were not banned , or if the lbw was given , or the flood lights had not gone out  etc etc . If there was ever a trophy for making excuses for losing a match , Bangladesh would win it every single time. Who knows there too they will celebrate before winning the trophy. They weren't unlucky to lose the game against IND , it was overconfidence in the last over.

BD proved that they are closely matched team to India in this game as well like the last game by getting out to 70s. NZ also proved that Ind and BD are no different and further reiterating the fact that they were the ODI world cup finalist.

@Robin292 I from SA agree and want to take their Test status and give to someone more deserving. Ban is only talk and no substance. I am frustated with their fans.

Funniest thing is before the match starts there will be 400 odd Bangladeshi fans writing we will thrash this team, Tamim 100 runs, musrafe best captain in the world etc etc. after the match there are hardly anybody of those seen here

This time BD had 1 run less to chase compared to the last match against India and who knows Mushi (Rahim) started to celebrate during innings break thinking that atleast we can manage a super over as we have to chase 1 less run.

Well done NZ, clear favourites for winning the cup.
A little disappointed with the result though, come on NZ don't be so good to miss the fun. Win by 76  runs is ok but if you win by 1 run it would have made so many cute minions cry. India did it and we enjoyed it. I request all the other teams to win against BD by 1 run and see the paper tigers become crying pussy cats.

Bangladesh is that one team that when it starts playing i go and take a nap. It cracks me up every time i see bangladeshi fans bashing other teams and calling themselves tigers when in reality they are the weakest team and the kind of team everyone loves scoring runs against. They have never won a WC or any tournament . Am a pakistani supporter and i support india or any other team when they play agains't bangla and thanks to their fans i just can't wait to see those sad faces every single time :)

Not the skill alone can win you a T20 matches these days. Those who think well win the most. T20 is the game of deliveries. You need sessions after sessions to win a test match, phase to win an ODI and a single delivery can win you a T20. You have to trust your abilities every moment can bring you back in the match, One wicket and you are there to hope for another one. That's how Nz have been playing in this WC. If a batsman is hotting you out of the park, make him wait, break his tempo, keep him away from the strike for a few balls, even bowl a wide or two intentionally, if you are bowling well don't let the batsman think, let him not recover, have a go at him before he makes a plan.

Bangladesh are still a minnow. They could not win a single game in super 10, even though they came very close upsetting India. But could not hold their nerves and that defeat will leave a mark on their psyche for at least some time. That defeat will dent their confidence that they acquired in last one year.

NZ spinners are way ahead compared to other spinners including India in Indian pitches. Really enjoyable I must say. I don't want to post any comments on BD team except that they can come up strongly in future hopefully. The BD fan club and crowd are spoiling the team's performance which is what I believe. Anyway well played BD overall. Good luck for the future. A word of caution to NZ team. SF and F are not going to be easy walk since all the contenders would have analysed your bowlers and batters by this time and may be waiting to whack you bad. So be very careful. If only if India meats you in the final that is going to be a different ballgame and how I wish to witness that but I know this is not the right time to say this. What I really wanted to say is please don't underestimate the Asian teams which have proven records to go for the kill at the right time. With Best Wishes.

Dear Mustafizur, we are so soooo lucky to have you in BD team. But you are so sooooo unlucky, you have some sense-less batters with your team.  You have the best bowling figure so far in this tournament, but your team-mates (Batters) have eared the worst (70/10) figure besides.

Should I add something more? In BD innings, You are the only 6 hitter among all the batters of your team. Hats off to you... You are the real entertainer. Love you, Love you &amp; Love you.

very sad ending to BD's WC campaign. i expected more of a fight, if not outright victory. they certainly bowled well - Fizz is a find or what ?! this shows up how far they still have to go, to be a major force in world cricket. They have the talent, maybe they need more time....all the best for future tournaments, BD !

Bangladesh batted the same way against India also. the difference was the very   rare 4 dropped catches by Indians and slogs going for boundaries. Not surprised that NZ did not repeat those mistakes. but they should not have made 140 on slower pitch than Bangalore.

I really want to know how many "Man of the Match" awards are given to bowlers in the past 5 years across all formats of the game. I wonder if a bowler gets MoM at least 1 out of 10 games. A bowler takes 5-22 in a match and still a batsman who scored 40+ runs gets the MoM award. I understand that it is mostly the winning team that gets the MoM award. But I want to know to how difficult it is to score 40 runs in a 20 over match against taking 5 wickets in a limited 4 over spell. People might even say that it is a bowling friendly wicket. But how about all the batsmen friendly rules we had so far? To me a bowler taking 4 wickets in an ODI match is as good as batsman hitting a century. But it is the batsman who gets the MoM. Cricket is becoming more and more batsmen game and we all know that. But at least by definition MoM should be given to the top performer of the Match and not the top performer of the winning team. Otherwise legends list will have only be batsmen and no bowlers.

Lets be honest about this Bangladesh have lost all of their games, in familiar conditions that they have at home, and they way they lost against India was the biggest choke ever. So no more excuses and deriding the opposition, umpiring decisions or bad luck, they are nowhere near good enough to compete against full strength teams as opposed to weakened touring sides forced to tour BD by the ICC.

@BOKESH: Seriously? I am an Indian fan and I must say I enjoy watching NZ cricket. Who doesn't?! Their brand of cricket is the only one that can still be called a "gentleman's game".  McCullum may not have had the technique that Tendulkar had but he was far more entertaining both as a batsman and a fielder. Besides, that is completely out of context. Just enjoy the game like BLACKCAPSBESTINTHEWORLD said.

All Bangladeshis didnt want Hom in the team. Well guess what he was the highest scorer with 16 not out. He should replace the Mushfiqur going forward.

Is this the lowest total of BD in an international T 20? I am not sure but certainly wanted BD to win this game. Given the typical subcontinent psyche, not sure what kind of reception they would get after arriving in Dhaka.

@MATTT_NZ So every pitch which is low and slow is horrible. But tell you what, atleast the grounds like Kolkata, Mohali and Nagpur are big enough to be called grounds. You see, nobody likes to play on a D shaped (60m at max) rugby fields in the name of cricket.

Bangladesh came to the tournament with the aim of upsetting one of the favourites but alas. A smaller goal would have been to score atleast 79 runs against NZ but again fell short. One thing has been proved that they are only strong at home and are the 4th or 5th best Asian team(depending on the outcome of the last Afgan match).

What a turnaround to this particular rivarly! BD strangled NZ with spin when NZ visited them the last couple of times, and now that NZ has better spinners than BD, they have routed BD for 70 (less than half of what NZ made)! Embarassment in the last game and complete humiliation in this one. 'hope BD and its fans can recover from this thrashing. On the bright side though, they came in as number 10 ranked side, so they haven't done worse than what the ranking indicates.

Bangladesh were given a chance by India's horrendous fielding and they even squandered it. while Bangladesh on paper will be the worst side of this group, I believe they are still better than Sri Lanka and Pakistan. they can give India a run for their money.

Both Mustafiz and Bumrah are too young and have a long way to go to prove their real caliber yet against and under all odd conditions. Amir is certainly better of both but at times goes erratic like against Austrialia. Out of all I would go with Rabada.

145 is easily a match winning score on a wicket like this. Mustafizur bowled really well, his cutters. Guy will go a long way. Sad to see a bowler as young and brilliant as him playing for a country which doesn't even win a single match. He deserves to be in a better team. But he'd be hoping to take his team far.

@SHariful Islam, because they are bowling good , and their field placing is according to their bowlers strength and their skipper is planning well.But they were bit overconfident and arrogant against Pakistan, lack of self belief against Aus due to the loss of Tuskin,lack of professionalism against India .Now they got a good score to chase let us see

Both teams playing freely. NZ have nothing to loose , BD under pressure of Nit winning Even a Single Game in the tournament . NZ is Not India to Miss Catches like Ashwin Bumrah nehra did . Pitch on slower side, I guess 145 is good enough to send Bangla packing .CATCHES WIN MATCHES !!!

You may call me by any name but I firmly believe that this score befits NZ very well. And I am saying so in spite of their wins in recent WC or this competition. It has always been a team who had got most of the success in their backyards and whose reputation has been blown out of proportion always. I still remember their plight against the likes of Bedi or Chandra way back in 1975 or so. scoring the fatest ton or tripel hundered with maximum "aada balla" cross batted shots does not rate you better batter than SRT or Vivian Richards who could play with equal ease on both sides.

This was the right time for them to check how these two performs. May be they turn out more effective than other bowlers and would have useful in the Knockouts. If not, They can go back to the old combination in the knockouts.

NZ should have picked Trent Boult and Tim Southee. This match is meaningless as they have already qualified and with adequate amount of NRR their top position is unchallenged.

Bangladesh, you may not qualify for the semis but at least you should win this game to console yourselves and your fans. Go tigers! You have it in you. Best Wishes from West Indies.

al amin is not a depth bowler but still BD is using him at the end , mashrafee should bowl , more experience slower pitch .  he cost some more runs which will be crucial for BD as like India's match,

Shouldn't Anton Devcich have been with the squad? Good backup for Guptill and provides solid left arm spin. Nicholls to me doesn't warrant selection in t20's at the moment.

@StevieS Early days these. I remember Mark Craig being proclaimed for greatness after West Indies series and he turned out to be public enemy number one (Though he would still be in my team).  We are playing on most conductive of the tracks in the most fickle format of the great sport And we've won all the tosses so I hope we lose one today and see how both operate when the plan A doesn't succeed.

Have we ever had 2 spinners playing together that  could turn a match? I have been following cricket since the 80's and I can't think of two, well it is a stuggle to think of one. The best thing is that thes two, being spinners, won't reach peak for another 8 or so years and they could be around for another 15 years!

I hope these performances earn Sodhi a long-format spot on the tours this year. More potential in him alone than the entire young NZ seam-bowling lineup. Huge career ahead, if things go right for him.

Sodhi was introduced to international cricket far too early it seems. If he can fulfil his potential in coming years then he might be just the missing piece we need in NZ's jigsaw

Bagladesh cricket team and fans as an Indian cricket fan firstly please accept my apology on my previous sarcastic comment. There is a bit animosity developing between both teams fans due to past few competitive matches we played and some of the nasty comments we exchanged between us during past month and half. My emotion took over me. Let us again be same good fans of real cricket than our own teams. You folks are truly developing into a good cricket team and that is good for cricket. Take Srilanaka on of our neighbors as example and develop cricket in your country and produce cricketers like Mehela, Jaisurya and Sangakara. Wish you all good luck for future and again please accept my sincere apology on my previous sarcastic comment and expect you also root for India and SL to go all the way to lift the T20 WC afterall we are all good neighbors.

@GOLDENEYE075 One cannot compare Bangladesh cricket team with that of Sri Lanka in terms of achievements or performance in the first 15 or so years of full ICC membership. Sri Lanka were soon challenging trough teams like Pakistan in their initial years, achieving acceptable win-loss ratio, whereas Bangladesh success stories have simply been too few and far between.

BD were out of competition even if they had won that match.For them to go ahead,they had to beat India and NZ and also recover a massive negative run rate to go ahead Aus and Pak,which was impossible.They just wanted to spoil India's party.And failed comically.

Dear Ritesh Prask thanks for a lovely cricket fan but I have a question -"They have the talent, proven over last two years, but their mindset ignores opposition success and therefore can't accept things gracefully" ----does it apply for cricketer or fans . If its for fans I agree. But if it for BD Player I am not agree bcoz ever you noticed .V. Kholi . A Jadeja recently new player Pandeya .their attitude..................................So please this advice for those player .....also

Ban can do well in future, but for that to happen they should develop an embracing attitude than the current adversarial one. They have the talent, proven over last two years, but their mindset ignores opposition success and therefore can't accept things gracefully. The same goes for most Asian teams, our teams play well but some of our supporters don't know the difference between passion and emotion. Cricket, if played with passion will be enjoyable. Look at WI, NZ teams. They win and lose and remain loved by every cricket fraternity. Their fans are most cheerful even of opposition players. Indian fans have gone through the maturity phase, yet sometimes slip back into emotional state and abuse players for losses. That's understandable. But with better education and experience of life, fans will mature accordingly and appreciate good skills and performance than being headstrong and haughty over self performance- whether good or bad.

Bangladesh like every other associate nation have the talent but not the temperament. Mushfiq must know that he might not get this chance again.
And if they can't change, they deserve to be put in the qualifiers.
Anyways like other associate nations they too are losing all matches in league phase.

BD's next challenge would be to succeed in tests. It would not be easy. Taskin was young and fast (he is suspended). The other quick bowler Rubel is injured. Sakib and the army of left arm spins would not it anymore. Mustafiz and AlAmin have wicket taking abilities. They would probably benefit a lot if there was an enforcer like Taskin on the other end. Bangladesh needs one more weapon. Tamim, Shabbir, MahmudUllah have matured a lot.  Sakib, Mushfique and Somya would be ok. Bangladesh's future depends if some of the younger players Mithun, Shadman or Liton can make it big.

Not sure how anyone could disrespect the advances Bangladesh has  made over the last five or so years.  Being a kiwi I reckon we know better than most how competitive they are so just makes no sense that some people keep calling them rubbish - NZ will definitely not underestimate BD in this last game, hope its a good one

We need Masharafee as long as possible , do not retire , as long as we are not getting a young inspiring captain . BCB take extra attention to his fitness,    Mehdi is in  the way to become captain , but it takes longer 5-6 years. Mahmudullah, Shakib and Tamim is in the way to become future captain.  most important part of captaincy is  have the ability to cheer your team members individually.

As an Indian fan I can assure you that we no longer feel comfortable playing against Bangladesh... you guys come super hard at us... you have truly improved big time and could see competing very hard for the no 1 Asian team too... respect... but it's very easy to find out when someone hates us... somehow both Bangladesh players and fans give this vibe of hatred to team India... am sure you guys will agree to this and hence you come across Indian fans who hate you profoundly... too much emotion is denying cricket to be the winner here... peace

@Akash Patel: I couldn't disagree with you more. Mashrafe Mortaza is the single biggest reason why Bangladesh has enjoyed success in the shorter formats. In hindsight Bangladesh's elevation to Test level was premature because that didn't have a First Class structure until 1999. But at home they are a force to reckon with, as evidenced by the bilateral series win last year against Pak, Ind, and SA.

@AKASH PATEL As if someone gifted Bangladesh a spot in the finals of Asia Cup and they could not win it. But the reality is, they played their way to the final and they could not overcome India. On the other hand, India and the top 8 nations were gifted super 10 spots in this world cup. And India is still may not even reach the semi-finals in home condition. If Bangladesh is so bad a team? Why did India have such a hard time beating them? Are you sure they will beat them next time?

@Akash Patel: Calm down buddy. Be happy about ending up on the winning side. Mash had a pretty good day against India. Nobody expected BD to win. Yet, BD came so close against a very good Indian team on Indian soil. No point in deriding the BD captain. He has helped tremendously to gel everybody as a team. BD's success in the last two years is a testament to the fact. 
As much as you wish Netherlands and Ireland to succeed more, how that is possible under the current ICC framework with associates getting very limited opportunities to play the top teams. This world cup was limited to 10 teams. ICC plans to do the same for the upcoming WCs as well. Under the current setup, it is very difficult for associates to come up. Kenya being a good example. I agree with you that BD still has some growing up to do. However, that day is not very far when BD will be a force to reckon with and will give all the big boys a run for their money. A win against BD won't be guaranteed anymore.

Dear Akash, I don't understand why you and  some other Indian fans have so much hatred (against Mashrafee in this case) over BD as a whole. I could say - your Dhoni's arrogance was shown when he answered the fist post match question and his retweeting Amitabh's tweet. I really don't want to touch that subject. Rivalry is good, hatred is not. You guys' super rejoice after winning against minions (in your words) and super attention in this news show some 'Indians' fans are still immature. If I am in your shoes, I would rather think about the game against Australia in stead of meaningless bashing. Of course, your comment don't make BD fans hate India more : we get the fact that over a country of 1 billion people, some will have worthless thinking style. India overall is a progressive country. Peace.

@AKASH PATEL Is anybody being harsher than you that you blame Mashrafee? He will congratulate the winning team for what? Being lucky? Now I believe Bangladesh could have won both Asia cup final and the first match against Pakistan in world T20 if they won the toss and obviously when all teams  had full strength, Bangladesh did not have Mustafizur.

This is no captain...its an insult to such title. He contributed nothing, barely answered according to the question asked by commentators upon losing. Never congratulated the winning team or their players. Lost asia cup, lost whatever he played in this cup and the fans love him!! Bangladesh is still a minion team and has a long long way to go. Ireland and Netherlands will make their impact sooner than this almost 2 decade and repeatedly  failing team

Such an inspirational captain. Of course you will get the usual fans deriding the progress of Bangladeshi cricket but even if you compare the image of Bangladesh cricket in 2014 with the cricket being played now .... There is a complete reversal. The commentators patronising approach is slowly being replaced with a begrudging acceptance.

Outpouring of emotions from "fans" is overrated. People who genuinely support Bangladeshi team are always with the team. Some seasonal supporters can't stop blaming someone or the other after something goes wrong. They always have done it and they will do it in the future. As long as Bangladesh team is playing good cricket, I see no reason to be disappointed. I think our chances are 50-50 against NewZealand. Best wishes for Mashrafe and the team.

BANGLA_TEAM - You are saying BD performed better than IND in the first 20 years ?  IN the first 20 years IND had already defeated ENG , AUS , PAK and NZ in test matches  , Won a ODI World Cup in england and WOrld series in Australia . IND even won the first ever T20 WC that they played. IND have a better win ratio in all formats in the first 15-20 years of competitive cricket than BD have. There is no possible statistic which shows BD is better than IND.  Yes IND lost some games to BD , but BD has lost to Afghanistan and Zimbabwer at home. Few wins and upsets here and there does not make BD a top team. BD Could not even win a single game in the group stage in this WC.

Fitting exit for BAN, 4-0. They ridiculed IND for getting all out for 79 in the very first match for IND against NZ. What goes around comes around. 70 a.o in 15.4 overs. I think the only way for BAN to win a world cup is, if Iceland, Finland, Antartica are the only countries that play cricket. I can't even include Afghanistan because it would be difficult for BAN.

@BANGLABANDHU: Even if your team beats NZ, it won't prove that your side is the best. You are yet to prove in international tournaments. Just with a few wins here and there won't make you great. India got one of the most difficult pitches in his tournament and yet they have survived so far. First respect other teams, success will follow.

I hope BD players play just like they played against India. NZ is a better team and will not give too many chances as India gave. If BD can give a good fight, I will be happy as a Bangladeshi. It still harts to imagine how we lost to India. Can India give a trophy to Mushfiqur and Mahamudullah for helping them to semi? Cricnfo, please publish. I got up at 2:30 am Washinton DC time to watch the match to start at 5:30 our time. Crazy Bengali.

Nasir is a good ODI player needs sometime to settle in. So He does not have a space in the team. He was not successful even in BPL this year. He will be a permanent in BD ODI and may be also in test. Imrul did better than him in BPL.

Bangladesh should have been in the other group. Too many minnows in that group as Srilanka, South Africa and England all worst than Bangladesh and Afganistan.
I say Bangladesh chance of winning is 40% and Srilanka chance of winning also 40% just because BD and SL are playing in subcontinent or those would have been even lesser,

BD can and will bounce back and as always the best team on the day will win! To those who think Afghanistan should get test status with the removal of BD test status, just shows you understand nothing about the game. Earn your own status as BD have done! Remember tests are played over five days and not three or four hours! May the best team today win!

Just forget about the last match and concentrate on the next match. My best 11 for BD is 1.Tamim 2. Sarker 3. Shabbir 4. Mushfique(He needs some time to spent in the crease to get his confidence back as he is going through a bad patch and coming in a time where he was in a rush to get his runs and falling to make proper shot selection) 5. Sakib 6. Mahmudulla 7. Nasir(Replecement for Mithun who is giving nothing but the burden to the team) 8. Mashrafee 9. Al Amin 10. Sajib(Replacement for Hom who does not deserve a place in the playing 11) 11. Mustafizur. 
Play like nothing to lose and try to enjoy the game. Good luck BD.

At the risk of sounding like a broken record, one more time - drop Al-Amin (not a international class bowler ), drop Rahim ( not a T20 player ). Sahib looks promising, Shuvagato also. Focus on spin since you are missing your better seam bowlers. And good that you dropped Soumya down the order like I suggested. Best of luck. No reason you cannot finish off an a high with a win - NZ is eminently beatable.

well, it seems rest of the world is feeling uncomfortable by celebrations of bangladesh cricketers and emotional fans. But I find nothing to be so upset about it. I tell you the major reason for this emotion. Bangladesh were struggling a lot after getting test status. Huge amount of frustrations, unbearable criticism, agony of continuous failure grabbed the whole nation. It was a quite a tough period for a cricket crazy nation. From 2012 onward, Bangladesh cricket started to get some positive outcomes. although 2014 was again a tough year, but with the captaincy of Mashrafe Bangladesh cricket is currently passing the best period in international arena. All the frustrations, criticisms that were mounted over the nation are now reflecting with their winning celebrations &amp; feedback. But, I think now world has finally accepted the improvement of Bangladesh cricket over the years. So, no doubt that fans and cricketers will be more positive with attitude and celebration in upcoming years.

It was too emotional of our team. India showed experience to keep calm under such situation. Hope we learn from it. Great captaincy from MS Dhoni and good to see the Mashrafe we know is back.

Bangladesh being an extremely emotional side, will still find ways to hurt themselves with such mental heaviness. Being passionate is one thing, but being emotional is another. Being passionate will help praise opponents success and learn, whereas being emotional will only result in premature celebrations and over-the-top celebrations during rare wins (example: when Ban defeated Pak in recent Asia cup). When Pak thrashed Ban in Kolkata later, surely they wouldn't have celebrated madly in Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi. Bangladesh players, with their resourceful talents, have to find a way to tune out their fans emotions and focus on the basics of the game, without wanting to aggrandize self achievements, which Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah will be forever guilty of.

Being passionate will help praise opponents success and learn, whereas being emotional will only result in premature celebrations and over-the-top celebrations during rare wins (example: when Ban defeated Pak in recent Asia cup). When Pak thrashed Ban in Kolkata later, surely they wouldn't have celebrated madly in Lahore, Faisalabad and Karachi. Bangladesh players, with their resourceful talents, have to find a way to tune out their fans emotions and focus on the basics of the game, without wanting to aggrandize self achievements, which Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah will be forever guilty of.

As an Aussie I would like to know why it's becoming increasingly popular to call Bangladesh 'little Australia'. I don't get it. What's the connection?

Bangladesh have grown through the ranks without doubt, but somehow their attitude is amiss. They treat cricket as though every game is some sort of war upon which their lives are dependent on. On the other hand, Afghanistan has shown swifter progress, with cheerful attitude and gives every vibe of them loving the game. Cricket is entertainment and fans will love to see better attitude along with performance, example being West Indies. Bangladesh can remedy that attitude and certainly their game performances will improve as a result.

I do not understand why people are keep telling that BD is not going to win. They already won against Oman,Netherlands and others. They have the top scorer and top wicket takers in this world cup so far. They will smash Kiwis which India, Australia and Pakistan failed. Watch out for the spirited tigers. If BD bats first they will post 250 and win by 100 runs and if they bowl first, they will restrict NZ to 95 and chase that in 10 overs.

Totally agree @outside-off. How many times have we been reminded of the so called banglawash now. It was 4 yrs ago with virtually a different team bar 4-5 players at the most. Time to move on Bangladesh fans or some of you at least.

Love yr optimism Bangladesh fans but to see the we have won 7-1 in odi's vs NZ in past four years is getting a little tiresome now. For one we won the game that really mattered in WC 2015 and if we really want to play the stats game I believe we are 17-8 up in odi's and 3-0 in t20's. Still with the nature of t20's anything can happen.  Go Black Caps!

To BD team: There is an England pace bowler Stuart Broad who was hit for 6 sixes by a batsman in similar WCT20 match. The whole world was watching. That bowler didn't succumb  because of that event. He bowled better and better and is one of the best bowlers for England. Your team is  being watched by the world only to see whether you succumb. Only if you succumb you will be treated as a failure not otherwise. Events like these happen all the time in cricket. Falling is alright. Not getting up is not. The world knows your team is still growing. From India fan.

Guptill has a bit of a hamstring strain so maybe Ronchi will open with Wiliamson. Boult, Nicholls, Southee and McCullum may also play. I expect Bangladesh to keep improving which will make for a good game. Perhaps the biggest difference between the 2 sides is their fielding.

I am a BD cricket fan. My simple questions is- why the selectors selected Nasir Hossain  in the squad and not playing any single match? Is he out of form? As I know- he has many major contribution in win against IND, PAK and SL from last 3 years. If I gave 3 star to Shuvagoto, then I will give 5 star to Nasir Hossain. He should include in the squad as a regular member then BD will get more from him.

Keep the same batsmen. keep mustafizur and rest all spin. open the bowling with shuvgata and shakib. bring mustafizur after the 1st wicket falls else bring him after the 4th over. all the best

there is nothing to prove for BD. they are, what they are; let them play the way they are playing. their performance against IND worth a lot more than those 2 points. and i would always like my team to earn success than having by luck. go ahead and keep playing the way you are playing as you have just trained and playing this format a few months back, after the last ODI home series.

Team India welcomes Bangladesh to the Champions Trophy in England in 2017 with open arms and happy heart. Team India hopes to crush Tigers in England and make them forget cricket  forever. From Kolkata to Dhaka is 30 minutes flight so BD should be home for dinner as soon as they leave Eden after another humiliating defeat.

BD has lost 3 out of 3, there is a reason they were made to last qualifiers. They are a long way from the men 's game. Even after 20years if the even beat zim, it's called an upset. Just imagine

If BD can pull this one off it will be a great achievement after the heartbreak of the last match. They have only pride to play for and noone would blame them if they were flat. The bowling could easily get the better of NZ on any given day. However i think the fact previous losses by NZ in a different format in a different era to BD keep getting brought up whenever NZ play BD time and time again are reflective of BDs chances

Bangladesh cricket team has performed very well over the last one year. They gave fierce competition in the ICC World Cup 2015 and in the match against India 2 days ago they played very well and were on course to win the game, but were unlucky. I am certain they'll give NZ a good fight and can even upset them.
The thing that hurts the team the most are their fans. BD fans have a tendency to look at statistics that make their team look like a perpetually unlucky team. The fans neglect the effort that current and former players put in to get to the point they are at today. Giving out incorrect statistics in like the comment below
"BD is 7-1 up aganist NZ in last 4 years in limited overs. Good luck to Bdesh to make it 8-1." Will only bring the morale of the fans down.

After the heart break loss with Ind, Lesson learnt: Winning is more important than winning by style, and It's not over until the last ball is played, then u can celebrate. Let's hope they can apply them in future. Now let's move on to the game with NZ. Tigers have good records against NZ, thou they're now table topper in group2; they've beaten them frequently at home, they've even came close to beat then in WC last year at their own den. Hope they play a good competetive game next in Kolkata, home of the other Bengal. Good Luck to both the teams &amp; Go Tigers.

Interesting that comments seems to show BAN fans and on the opposing end there are ...eh... IND fans ....hmmmm. Anyway, BAN are getting rate exposure to play in India so they have to make the most of it. There are many positives to take from the IND match. Even if BAN doesn't see them, AUS have made a note of it. BAN just need to carry on and by beating NZL, will improve their T20 ranking points. If it s a good game tomorrow BAN can compare their performance with how the other teams played against NZL. Nothing to lose and everything to gain. If feel that BAN will win.

It would be hard for any team to get up off the deck after taking a gut punch like BAN suffered the other day. But that is what good teams do and if BAN believe they are a good team (the fact they had to qualify for the tournament is still one of the stupidest things I have seen for some time) they have to cowboy up. Even if NZ lose the likelihood of being passed on NRR by IND or Oz is near 0, which is just as well because it would be wise to stay away from playing the Windies as long as possible. They batted horribly today but still managed to win. I would give Nicholls a game as well as N.Mac, Southee and Boult and rest Taylor, Milne, Mitch Mc and Ish. One never knows when a case of Delhi Belly might strike so it is time for the other guys to get some playing time in and get them acclimated for the SFs.

@AKASH PATEL - WE were not allowed to enter but got to international level with our efforts without anyone's help.It was India who were allowed to enter into the international areana only because of the interest amongst their population about cricket not by performance.If you look India ' s performance in their first 20 years of cricket you will see how hapless they were.BD's performance has been 100 times better than India in the same period.Being a country with the largest population in the world you should have achieved more than just 2 Cricket WC,which out of one with pure luck and other at playing at home.You don't have any success or talent in other sports that's why you are trying to control cricket which only subcontinent people cares about.Atleast show some good performance in other sports as well.

No more mithun ali plz wastes far too many delivery then gets out leaving pressure on others. Selectors have got few questions to answer too. Shubagoto, mithun not promising at all.

@AMAN HAGUE.Its not about selectors I believe.Bangladesh as a team have come a long long way since their inception into international cricket.They are a team which noone takes lightly anymore,and have built the image of a tough team to beat around them over the last few years.It was the same selectors even then.Problem was that the fans expected them to do the same away from home just yet.Its never easy.And they have fought well in all their games.Any xi they wud have brought,they might have lost.But u shud see how far they have come in international cricket,and the growth in stature.Time wil bring rewards,just not yet.Picking xis and changing selectors won't change things,the team is going in the right direction.

@AMAN HAGUE.Its not about selectors I believe.Bangladesh as a team have come a long long way since their inception into international cricket.They are a team which noone takes lightly anymore,and have built the image of a tough team to beat around them over the last few years.It was the same selectors even then.Problem was that the fans expected them to do the same away from home just yet.Its never easy.And they have fought well in all their games.Any xi they wud have brought,they might have lost.But u shud see how far they have come in international cricket,and the growth in stature.Time wil bring rewards,just not yet.Picking xis and changing selectors won't change things,the team is going in the right direction.

There is no way bangladesh can win against in form NZ. They lost to Pak and Ind. Both struggling teams managed to beat them. NZ will demolish this team. Its been 15  years since BAN was allowed to enter international cricket. About 10 chances to win a big tournament but they didnt even advance to semis. The fans however, seem to think they won every single trophies lol. What a team. No other coutnry has taken this long. GO kiwies!!

What a wonderful contribution BAN has added to this T20 WC. Those amazing Sarkar catches will be on many highlight reels. The close match with AUS and of course that historic thrilling T20 Match of the ages with India. To think that BAN had to qualify through associate teams before getting into this stage. I am looking for a positive approach once again and hopefully another thriller.

@SANJYOT47: You are not right. In their last match and the match against AUS BD has already proven themselves. It is the same BD without any mental pressure. Tomorrow they will blow away NZ. I do not want to predict the outcome of a T20. However, I have a strong feeling we will see a more than real BD tomorrow. To me performance is more important than those 2 points. NZ is already there. Consequently, this is going to be a tough fight between two opponents with no mental pressure at all.

Time to move on Bangladesh because as a nation, we are too proud to be stuck and looking back in regret. We are far better then these few unfortunate errors! We should learn how to be best in coping when disaster strikes and be the best in re-building after a disaster. Learn from our mistakes! We might make new mistakes but atleast don't make the same mistakes again and that is the best way to progression. Best of luck to both teams.

why sana is playing Dina baig the talented fast bowler, she  should get chance to play. she got 8wickets in 4hours in domestic match. why she is the 12th women in the team for last 2years. Sana is to keep first the country in front not her friends.

Looks to me that England keep coming close to fluffing their run chases, particularly if the wickets start tumbling. So, Pakistan need to win the toss and bat first, then put the pressure on. I really don't think Pakistan need to fear England.

I was completely overawed by the superb and stupendous performance of the girls in green. They played very freely, positively and as a team as a unit. Their confidence was par excellence. No grouping no rivalry among them and everyone played their due part for this big win. Captaincy of Sana Mir's was exceptional and a great team leader. Hope the boys in green will learn to obey and respect from the girls in green. Hats off to Sana and his team, wish you all the best for the remaining matches in T-20 world cup. You made your country proud. Keep it up and best of luck.

What a thumping win for Pakistan.  CONGRATULATIONS  to the girls in green. The important thing is they have started to believe in themselves as reflected by the their 2 consecutive wins. Victories are achieved by converting potential into performances &amp; by minimizing errors and these girls have been exactly trying doing that.  Well done Sidra Ameen and Bismah Maroof for wonderful knoks. Hope they continue with the same spirits and form in the much important match against mighty England to be able to make it to the semi.

Dear Md. Isam, I am sorry to say that you made a mistake at nrr calculation in case of Pakistan's defeat! Pakistan will not reach semis if they lose because their nrr is lower than both India and WI. If pakistan loses, they are out. Then it will be the winner of the match between WI and India who goes through.

The author does no mention of the Indian Women team chances. The article says that Pakistan will still go through even if they lost and West-Indies is beaten. But that is wrong. If pakistan lose, their net run-rate will get lower, same with West-Indies if they lose to India. And India already with a better run-rate will still improve further and move to 2nd spot. Fair analysis needed.

Dhoni needs to be fired as a captain. This win was a fluke not clever captaincy. His team selection, field placements and choice of bowlers are  ridiculous. Bumrah should not have bowled early on when he under pressure. Pandya was terrible choice for last over. BD lost their mind but other teams will not.

Being on the field and playing the game is very different from watching the game on TV. But just by being a spectator, I thought there were enough mistakes in Dhoni's captaincy, with the exception of the last ball. But all that mattered to win this match was the last ball, so I would say in the big scheme of things, Dhoni was accurate. I thought Dhoni's captaincy against Pakistan was also fairly off, but India won that game fairly without a contest, so Dhoni was accurate with that one as well. I'm just hoping that all the inaccuracies that I feel just by watching the games on TV will start to disappear or I hope to get a chance in the Indian cricket team to convince myself that Dhoni is in fact accurate and that I just got it all wrong all along.

Dhoni did right by using Bumrah in the 17th and 19th over as despite a poor match,Bumrah is accurate at the death and is the 1st Indian speedster, who bowls yorkers with accuracy.A wayward Pandya might have conceded 10-12 runs leaving Bumrah almost nothing to defend in the last over.6 runs in the 19th over left Bangladesh with a substantial 11 to get in the final over and Pandya nearly conceded those,but for the harakiri committed by Rahim and Mahmudullah. Looking forward to a Pakistan win as that would deal a further blow to Australia's confidence after they somehow just managed to put it across Bangladesh.However,conditions in Mohali and Nagpur will be vastly different from what OZ faced in Bangalore. Hope the pitch India plays OZ in Nagpur on Sunday offers help to the spinners as that would make Ashwin and Jadeja all the more potent.Would love to see Bhajji/Negi play in place of Pandya as India badly needs the extra spinner with Nehra/Bumrah doing well in the pace department.

Well played MSD and team India. Tough Luck BD boys. By now you must have realized that the actual celebration should start only after you cross the finish line. One of the finest matches in the recent times and the better team won. There is no point in blaming players or circumstances, finally what count is the win. Winners make their own Luck and Losers makes excuses. All the best team India, the biggest hurdle is just around the corner. Hope to see a better batting and fielding performance against the Aussies. Cheers!

What a great comment by Barfi .... i totally agree with you. Had india lost the game, everybody would blame him for giving last over to Pandya and every one will blame Bumrah for the drop catch but now they are the heroes

I think Dhoni should admit they India did not play to their potential or did not gave 100% performance instead of saying news reporters do not want india to win.
</p>
<p>
Every on says indian team is great under dhoni captaincy, but its fluke and luck. Even winning world cup in 2011 india never dominated like australia.

Dhoni needs to be fired as a captain. This win was a fluke not clever captaincy. His team selection, field placements and choice of bowlers are  ridiculous. Bumrah should not have bowled early on when he under pressure. Pandya was terrible choice for last over. BD lost their mind but other teams will not.

JNT222: "Ridiculous to say India were so amazingly calm under pressure. They were ok and didn't muck it up." Yup it's ridiculous what every knowledgeable cricket expert is saying/has said but your opinion is absolutely right on money and we shouldn't question it at all.

Dhoni continues his wierd choices of playing out of form players like dhawan. He should have some definite reason otherwise this may come to haunt him.

Being on the field and playing the game is very different from watching the game on TV. But just by being a spectator, I thought there were enough mistakes in Dhoni's captaincy, with the exception of the last ball. But all that mattered to win this match was the last ball, so I would say in the big scheme of things, Dhoni was accurate. I thought Dhoni's captaincy against Pakistan was also fairly off, but India won that game fairly without a contest, so Dhoni was accurate with that one as well. I'm just hoping that all the inaccuracies that I feel just by watching the games on TV will start to disappear or I hope to get a chance in the Indian cricket team to convince myself that Dhoni is in fact accurate and that I just got it all wrong all along.

Dhoni did right by using Bumrah in the 17th and 19th over as despite a poor match,Bumrah is accurate at the death and is the 1st Indian speedster, who bowls yorkers with accuracy.A wayward Pandya might have conceded 10-12 runs leaving Bumrah almost nothing to defend in the last over.6 runs in the 19th over left Bangladesh with a substantial 11 to get in the final over and Pandya nearly conceded those,but for the harakiri committed by Rahim and Mahmudullah. Looking forward to a Pakistan win as that would deal a further blow to Australia's confidence after they somehow just managed to put it across Bangladesh.However,conditions in Mohali and Nagpur will be vastly different from what OZ faced in Bangalore. Hope the pitch India plays OZ in Nagpur on Sunday offers help to the spinners as that would make Ashwin and Jadeja all the more potent.Would love to see Bhajji/Negi play in place of Pandya as India badly needs the extra spinner with Nehra/Bumrah doing well in the pace department.

Well played MSD and team India. Tough Luck BD boys. By now you must have realized that the actual celebration should start only after you cross the finish line. One of the finest matches in the recent times and the better team won. There is no point in blaming players or circumstances, finally what count is the win. Winners make their own Luck and Losers makes excuses. All the best team India, the biggest hurdle is just around the corner. Hope to see a better batting and fielding performance against the Aussies.

Ridiculous to say India were so amazingly calm under pressure. They were ok and didn't muck it up. 
</p>
<p>
But the ones who did muck it up were Bangladesh. They threw this away. Looking just at the last over, why even try for a boundary? Caught in the deep needing just 2 from 3 balls? Brainless. Hit it on the ground and run two singles...  
</p>
<p>
I've seen choking, but this was just plain stupid.

@chotteguru.. You are right.. Dhoni must give a chance to Yuvi at no 3.. I bet u Yuvi will have better average better strike rate then present top 3 batsmen.. Dhoni also should come up the order to up the run rate.. I have Request for Dhoni please don't sacrifice your batting carrier to somebody selfish batsmen who only make his own runs and don't rotate strike and who play more balls than others in partnership.. they will not be match winners.. Glen Maxwell had bitter words but true words about top order Indian batsmen.. that Indian top 3 batsmen play for mile stones not a match winners.. and yes Maxwell is right.. Dhoni is one &amp; only real match winner for India.. hats off to Captain Cool Dhoni.. Jai ESPN

When you are a winner you can say whatever you want to say. If India would have lost the match then Dhoni's captaincy would have been questioned. This game was not won by the Indian Captaincy. It's rather lost by the two incompetent thinker from Bangladesh Team. What Dhoni showed really is how to manipulate the pressure by taking 11 minuted between the 3 and 4th ball and another 3-4 before the last to fumble the batters and he was successful. But that would not be possible against a team like South Africa or Australia. Bangladesh has themselves to blame for the utter nonsense loss. hats off to Indian team who showed that never lose hope even before the last minute!

this is the second time that the Indian team fumbled totally in batting and to certain extent in fielding and bowling,they should have learnt lessons from the newzealand tie.
     in my opinion ,NEWZEALAND andENGLAND are adopting fine technical strategies and one of them will be the champion ultimately.

Whatever the result, the Indian batting line-up has performed like has-beens, which a few are. Both Rahane and Manish Pandya deserve a place. With Yuvi not performing with the bat and not being used for bowling, why is he chosen?

@sauravjain.. You are right Rahane is better player to make runs in top 3 order.. but he must maintain strike rate.. if any batsmen plays 20 balls then he is settled.. in this case our top 3 batsmen are settled.. and thrown wickets away with bad strike rate.. top 3 batsmen are playing test cricket.. middle order struggles because of this,, Yuvi didn't get enough balls to play.. if yuvi placed in no 3.. and bat without any pressure you cant imagine what score is going to happen.. so better watch strike rate of top 3 batsmen without pressure.. Dhoni got very poor strikers at top 3 &amp; average bowlers, then also some how Dhoni is managing team. hats off to captain MS Dhoni.. Jai ESPN.......

MSD's style of captaincy is similar to DL method &amp; therefore difficult for some to comprehend. MSD with his contributions as player &amp; captain has already leap frogged as the best ever captain in all forms of cricket in history of the game. Cricket is a multi-dimensional sport that involves batting, bowling, fielding etc. Rarely impact of fielding errors is analysed leading to erroneous conclusions about captaincy. IND missed opportunity of test series win in NZ in 2014 due to 4 dropped catches of premier NZ batsman that cost IND 350+ runs. BD bowled &amp; fielded well to restrict IND to 146 (a defendable total). IND would have won by a good margin had they not dropped 2 easy catches that cost 40 runs. As a result, the contest became closer. BD batted positively &amp; maintained left-right batting combination making use of part time spinners risky. As T20 games progress captain has to adapt to developing match situations. MSD's captaincy with bowling rotation was spot on &amp; Pandya deserved MOM.

Dhoni's philosophy is sound but he is the creater of this chaos by his choice of players. In T20, economy in bowling is critical. Only Ashwin &amp; Jadeja have proven economy in bowling. Nehra is wayward as is Pandya. Bumrah can be very effective on his day but every bowler has an off day. So to support some of his expensive bowlers Dhoni needs one more reliable batsmen who can score against any bowling. Unfortunately Kohli, the sheet anchor of Indian batting, did not stay at one end as he always does. So it is obvious that India needed one more specialist bat who can stay at one end for a long partnership. Yuvraj playing just as a batsman is failing. Raina is also a huge failure! So one of them should be replaced with only other bat in the squad- Rahane. If Dhoni does not like him, let Bhaji/Negi replace one of the pace bowlers to provide economy &amp; restrict the opposition total! This Indian XI is unbalanced &amp; needs some changes to avoid "Chaos"!

@NKOCH Very Right. India and MSD need to rethink over guys who will execute well in these conditions. Hardik PANDYA,Shami,Mishra,Bhajji? And who from Yuvi,Dhawan,Rahane,Vijay,Manish Pandey. I think Shami/Mishra/Bhajji will serve better than Hardik . Also Manish Pandey and Rahane are better than present day Dhawan,Yuvi.

JAYZUZ  - some more for guys like you who have started watching cricket recently. India lost a world cup match by 1 run to Australia in 1987 after being in a very good position. In 1992, India threw it away after Manjerakar, Azhar gave away momentum to lose to Australia by 1 run. Zimbabwe in 1987 world cup after Dave Houghton heroics lost narrowly to NZ. Narrow matches and team throwing away initiatives have always been there. Also, none of the 1987 and 1992 Indian team were good enough. Zimbabawe didnt rule the  world after 1987 world cup coming close to NZ. Allan Border was ace in 1987 and 1992 world cup matches against India managing his team very well. Captain gets credit. As somebody else wrote on other thread, Dhoni did win it yesterday with 2 runs of last ball in Indian Innings and then saving 1 run of last ball in BD innings. So, he deserves all the accolades.

MSD never mentioned of real match winner and MOM of great Ashwin also he took poor decision by given Bowling to Bumrah when he got pressure after drop the catch that resulted unwanted 16 runs in one over when the team need to restrict runs otherwise the match will be balanced.

Yesterday everything went wrong including openers as usual and Virat who rarely play slow game,Raina survived few occasions,Yuvi gone early after eat some balls as expected,Jaddu never help the team, MSD's power unable to lighted as necessary except Hardik who shown real temperament as T20 player's strokes which created fear on BD faces so nobody played their game with real spirit,
Seems the whole match India played against world best team not like BD,
Some more MSD praised everyone whose outplayed except Ashwin who is the key player turn the game with 2 wickets and given below RR also MSD took

right before 2nd last ball of the over, Jadeja was sent back who took that catch. Right before last ball, Dhoni removes right hand glove to gain extra 0.2538 second to hit the stump. Is that luck or strategy?

It is the last ball of the indian innings and the last ball of the bangaladesh innings that mattered. The hero in both the cases in Dhoni. Dhoni ran 2 runs of the last ball of indian innings, although Ashwin wanted only one. And, the last ball of Bangladesh innings is history.......

Let this be written in gold, 'Dhoni is the best ODI and T20 captain India ever had and will ever have' at least in the near future. Less said the better about his test captaincy I find the documentaries more interesting than watching him captain a Test side.
Coming to his strength though in the limited over format his uncanny poise in face of tight situations is scary to the point you wonder if this man has any feelings at all. Then you have the jaw dropping decisions on field and somehow it is the right decision. I would not for the life of me have given the last over to Pandya but despite the onslaught we all know what the final outcome was, I would not be surprised if he gives Pandya another go in a similar situation next time. Dhoni himself used to the perfect words to describe himself in these situations 'managing chaos' of which I believe he is an expert. I hope IN win the title to give their captain the farewell he deserves.

JAYZUZ - If you have not seen any team fall over like that , you havent been watching cricket for too long. Steve waugh is credited till today for 1999 WC semis win or tie against SA even though SA was in grip of match all along. It was SA who couldnt get over the line. But Steve did his bit by getting his bowlers, fielders in place. Dhoni himself did it against SA in 2011 when SA lost 2 or 3 wickets losing by 1 run. Dhoni himself did it at the other end when he batted with Ishant sharma to score 40 odd runs and scoring 15 against SL in final over in Westindies couple of years ago. If BD choked - it was because Dhoni took his time to put his mind. If you watched yesterday's game, in the last couple of overs Dhoni was on his own planning and scheming, before Nehra stepped in . When  tough situations arrive, he knew how to get his bowlers Bumrah , Jadeja to deliver. Ashwin is a master at it. So,if Dhoni can take flak for all failures, why not take credit for victories.

First of all great game and well played Bangladesh. Should be really tough for them to digest this loss! India were really lucky to win it from that spot of 2 runs to win from 3 balls, unlike what a few of my fellow Indians say. 
</p>
<p>
But again Luck as well as lack of skill by BAN batsmen was the key. It didn't help that Ban used up all their luck early on. Tamim &amp; Shakib Dropped, Shabbir getting a 6 and a 4 of top edges, misfields by India etc, compared to IND getting pegged back by stunners from Shabbir and Soumya. 
</p>
<p>
Their share of luck waited to embrace them in the last three balls. 
</p>
<p>
BAN bowled beautifully and Rahim just got a lil overconfident after the two fours.  and atleast thought that Riyad was there to finish it even if he gets out but what was Riyad thinking? Both the balls were nothing to be proud of except that hardik took the pace off both the balls. I could feel my heartbeat in my brain, such was the game, a real pressure cooker. Thanks to both teams for the humdinger!!

@SayItLikeItIs ,NZ read the pitch well and that's suits to them and defended the 129 &amp; 142 ,India is not lucky already they have dropped few catches &amp; miss field  by Bumrah else it will be finished with two overs to spare ,then captain cool did it in the end with presence of mind &amp; under pressure .Never said Pandya bowled well !!!

Luck played it part for both teams but majorly for BD. Tamim would have been caught 99 out of 100 times for that dropped sitter by Bumrah. After that Tamim hit four boundaries in the next over. Ashwin dropped another sitter. Dhoni could not hold onto one. Nehra had a difficult chance. At least 3 or 4 boundaries by BD batsmen were off edges which could have gone any where. On the other hand, India was only lucky for two balls 19.4 and and 19.5. The last ball was not lucky., It is called Clinical Execution

Team India did everything to lose the match from start to end. Batted atrociously. It was Bangladesh's emotional mismanagement gifted the match to India. HP gave 9 runs in his first three balls, what else you want to do to lose match.

This loss will haunt Bangladesh but it will make them stronger.  They have the potential to be a top 4 team in the T20 format with their many all-rounders much like NZ and WI.

India is ranked No.1 in T20, and Bangladesh is no 10, in-spite of their recent advancements, the fact remains on paper it should have been little contest,
But yes time to focus on positives, job well done, 
but batting needs to flow freely soon, 
else it will be a game of fewer errors in the remaining campaign for India as well. 
Yesterday dropped catches by India were outperformed by brain fade by BD at end.

Congratulations to India. However the question must be asked why did it come this close? New Zealand defended 129 and 142 comfortably against India and Australia, why couldn't India have won more comfortably against Bangladesh who have lost all their matches before this?

India were lucky they won - if you see the 4th ball it was a full toss, so no great bowling there although everyone's going with the flow and praising the bowler and captain for keeping their nerve. The last ball was good and credit to both Pandya and his advisors before the ball, but let's not say India won because they bowled the last 3 balls superbly after the 2 boundaries in the last over!

Bangladesh paved in under pressure. Dhoni gets the credit. He anyways can't say that Bangladesh played badly in the last over. That would be undiplomatic.

@NADIRB1  : If you go back and see the match again  then you will realize india had thrown away more than bangladesh  untill the last ball was bowled.
</p>
<p>
1. 4 catches dropped, all those full-tosses, half volly
2. All the Indian batsmen thrown their wicket after getting set
</p>
<p>
By the way bangladeshi bats men were getting edges and still able to find boundaries while indian's mistimed shots were going to the fielders .
</p>
<p>
Please respect.

Who would have thought before the tournament started that this Bangladesh side would give the Indian team a fightback like this.  Everyone was busy calculating how much should India score out of their already weakened bowling attack to correct the net run rate.....

Dear Posters, pls know at some point in time a country would have improved to the standards required. We too did it around 1990s, Srilanka did it 2000s. Bangladesh is at it now -2010s. Only Zimbabwe who has long history of being a regular cricketing nation is still at being the 'babes'!! Someone posted that it should have been a one sided game...now come on lets give it to that country, that is in the big league-just at the entry point. So let us celebrate that we won against a very competitive side, a strong side, a strong under dogs. And lets give Bangladesh the credit due to them. Keep it up Bangs...next time I will not be surprised that you will come out the winner.

Before the match the talks were of improving the run rate, 
Actually the match should have been one sided, 
Batting needs to flow freely in pressure matches, that is handling the pressure, 
in the end its a great escape, but hope the team doesn't get used to it.

No penalty for bowling last over, as far as time is concerned. I think, India made a few mistakesand could scape through because of a weak opposition. Aganist bigger teams, they can afford to make so many mistakes.

Dhoni can't be fined. 
I understand that a team can take any amount of time in the 20th over.
Dhoni knows the rules and uses them well to his advantage.

It was not India's day against Bangladesh. We just got lucky in the end. The Bangla batsmen were more keen on glory than getting the job done.  None of the Indian players stood out in the game. Basically it was a game for Bangladesh to lose. I am hoping Indians will lift their game against better sides.

Managing the chaos? His bowler gave away two boundaries and he misfielded the lap to fine leg.
</p>
<p>
His bowlers then bowled a juicy length ball and a terrible half volley.
</p>
<p>
The only reason India won from that position had nothing to do with anything India did. Bangladesh threw the game away. India were basically down and out, and the final over was terribly bowled.
</p>
<p>
It's ridiculous that he's trying to paint it as some kind of effort from India that got them the win.

Dhoni did well but what plan did Pandya execute well? Only good ball in that last over was the last one . Apart from that, he bowled  1, 4, 4, short ball wkt, full toss wkt and good ball wkt. Pandya almost costed us the match but won because of shear luck. Is he another Joginder Sharma in making? Has his best moment of the life has just passed??

having said that all the lapses in batting fielding and bowling in first half of the the innings , it is MSD the coolest captain on the planet earth brought this victory. It is amazing the way he lead his team. From 22 year old Bumrah to veteran Nehra, MS brought everyone into action.Given freedom to express their thinkings,tactics,ideas.. Young Bumrah had a forgetful few minutes early in the innings but MS kept his faith on him and last two overs he produced a match winning performance. The courage he has shown to complete quote of the most experience bowlers like aswin,nehra early and hand last over to pandya is what MSD.Not many captains would have done that. The best captain in limited over cricket by miles MSD... Also my MOM is pandya for his all round performance.. A little cameo with bat, brilliant catch and his match winning last over.......

Well, Mushfiqur played his part really well. A true comedian. 2 agressive shots followed by a premature animated celebration even before winning. Hitting to a full toss straight into the fielder's hand and leaving the ground shaking his head down with disappointment. This match had all the ingredients. Still some funny moments were missing. Well Musifiqur you really fulfilled that. We will remember this comedy for ever. Thank you Musifiqur.

@JAYZUZ: People who blame luck or just believe in pure luck will never succeed. You say "the truth" but the only truth here is India held its nerve and won. The other team didn't. Everything else you said (99 out of 100, etc.) is hypothetical. India did play this match very poorly though like they very often do in Bangalore. The type of performances they have been putting in is not going to help them win against Aus let alone the world cup.

Seriously, I don't understand why Dhoni was not the Man of the Match. He was very much the MoM. Why don't people consider Captaincy, which grays hairs, as MoM material. Further, in this match, Dhoni made 13 runs, did 2 stumpings and effected 1 run out. And apart from all this, was his cool captaincy. If this is not MoM material, I don't know what is. Accepted that Ashwin bowled wonderfully, but I guess Dhoni did more than that!

@JAYZUZ Even I don't like MSD as a captain but even a blind just by listening can tell who won the match yesterday. Losing the toss, defending a paltry 147 and dropping 4 catches which haters just don't remember tells it was his captaincy that won us the match. I never expected him to bowl his best bowlers before 20th over but he did.   Keep hating while we keep winning.

@ JAYZUZ Calm down. Dozens of matches has been lost this way. Upcoming teams have done this. Sri Lanka and Zimbabe has lost matches like this dozens of times. India,WI etc.. have lost matches like this. Calm Down. Bangladesh is not 3 times world champions. Dhoni doesn't have telekinesis but he has enough experience and instincts on how to stretch a match to last over and putting pressure on the batsmen to induce an error.

Fantastic read. MS Dhoni's words are pure gold and should be made part of every management course syllabus. He could have brought back Joginder Sharma out of retirement to bowl this last over to BD. And India would have still won.

With due respect to Bumrah, one good hit from Mahmudullah or Mushfiqur could have sealed that game for them. India were never really in the game after bundling out for 147 and with three dropped catches.! Dhoni made three back to back bowling selection mistake by not including Bhajji!. Just think what he along with Ashwin could have done  on the rank turners India have been playing on. Bhajji does a great role in containing for Mumbai indians. Even though Pandya held his nerve in the last ball playing him does not make sense especially on the kind of pitches India are getting for their fixtures. Australia/SA could have won such a game hands down!. India face Australia next up who are not great players of spin. Playing Bhajji in place of Hardik could well seal the game for India! Other than this one selection miss everything seems just in place for India to lift the trophy!

MSD at his best!! Superb thinking, plan , field arrangment by MSD and well executed by Pandya.  Big concern of slow test match players Dhawan, Rohit, does not look like they are openers in any format, after Great Sachin and Sehwag. Middle order is getting weaker with Raina and some time showcaser Kohli. Today again Pandya, MSD has to play his part to add more last runs and search for boundry in desert of death deliveries, as already lot of delivery wasted early on by IPL stars Rohit, Dhawan, Kohli, Raina.  Are you all playing world cup?? then why your batting is worst than IPL ????? Need to say good bye, no more opportunity should be given to irresponsible batman of India. Today  India could have make 180 and should have win massive to be table topper and in semis, could be the weak england, now India has to play well agains aus and could be facing west indies tough one in semis!!! Indian batsman played cricket in all pitches but they are struggle to score with 200 strike rate in t20!

It was wrong decision to give Pandya 3 overs when ball was turning. If he used raina/yuvi, India would have won it by 15-20 runs.

The match was only stretched that long because of India's terrible catching. Had they taken all the chances they were offered (I count atleast 4 catches that were dropped), Bangladesh would have never got that close. It is about time, we thought of changes in our top order which is putting too much pressure on middle order. How about making Yuvi come early  instead of Raina. Raina only knows one way to play and he can get you quick runs lower down the order as well. I can also see Yuvi being under bowled even on spin friendly wickets which is hurting India in middle overs.

Dhoni &amp; his gang had that mini meeting before the final ball, precisely for that.
</p>
<p>
To find that needle of success in the hay stalk, swirling around in the middle of the ground. Stirred up by two mini, but conflicting  cyclonic storms of pressure from the neighbouring, but battling troops. Lead by two cunning commanders, of different ilk, with troops of different vintage, in terms of international experience.
</p>
<p>
In the last battle, two lieutenants of one commander, lost their heads going for glory.  His team got pinned down. The hang-man of the other, put the noose around the neck of the victim, as he was told. 
</p>
<p>
And finally, the latter commander &amp; his troop, who kept their nerves better, won. Found the needle of success. 
</p>
<p>
After the storm, such a calm. From pressure to pleasure. 
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile many of us lost a bit of our nails. If you were an Indian fan, that was worth the loss.

"Success has many parents while failure is an orphan" India played very poorly yesterday. If Bangladesh had won the match, Dhoni's speech would have different. The way they miss fielded and drop the catch under pressure, it can be only said it is Bangladesh who lost the game on their own.

@JAYZUZ As usual you were not neutral in your comment. 11 runs were needed in that last over, no way was it a given for BD. you also ignored the excellent overs by Bumrah. Bangladesh had plenty of luck with the bat with dropped chances. you just ignore that but are quick to mention Rohit getting dropped some days ago.

I am going to be a little harsh here. But I still think MSD need not bowl Pandya for more then 2 overs. His economy rate is too high. It looked spectacular in the end and credit to Pandya for executing what his captain planed for. But the cold reality is he conceded 2 fours of 1st three balls and then 2 senior Bangladeshi batsmen hold out on 2 full tosses. MSD needs to bowl Yuvraj and Raina bit more. He can easily get 4 overs out of them and they do have happy knack of taking wickets. Pandya can bowl 2 and cover for overs in case any of top 4 bowlers are having a off day.

He can easily get 4 overs out of them and they do have happy knack of taking wickets. Pandya can bowl 2 and cover for overs in case any of top 4 bowlers are having a off day.

I don't think India won this match out of luck. Bumrah, Ashwin , Nehra all dropped catches. Even dhoni dropped Soumya Sarkar at a crucial stage. 4 Catches dropped and still India managed a win. I think Dhoni must be applauded for his Cool head and Wicket keeping skills which brought back India into the game. Bumrah came back strong after that initial onslaught by Tamim. Ashwin and  Jadeja bowled well. Pandya was just executing the plans of Dhoni and Nehra in the final over. Overall, I think India did very well to win it. Despite being a big fan of the Indian team, I don't think India deserve a place in the semi finals looking at the way they are playing.They need to improve their batting.

Some People are saying "it is  Bangladesh who  Lost and India did not win" ...how is that possible ??  Bangladesh lost because   India WON  ...Is there any other way in which you can loose ??  Dhoni, by far, is the best captain in the tournament and his out of the box  thinking and street smartness is way, way above the rest !! And one bad day in the field does not make India a sloppy fielding unit....The are still a  very good fielding side, perhaps the best in the world with lightening fast gathering coupled with strong &amp; accurate throws !!This team is going to go the distance once again...Best of Luck Team India !!

A target of 147 on a slow pitch meant a close contest. Dhoni made a tactical error to continue with Bumrah in the powerplay after he dropped a catch.  The clearly rattled Bumrah leaked 4 fours and this got Bangladesh going and stayed that way almost till the very end.  The counter balance was the bold gamble of Dhoni to bring on Ashwin in the 12th over to prize out Shakib.  From thereon India inched bit by bit to give themselves a shot.  Bumrah came back brilliantly with 2 pinpointed yorker filled overs with support from Nehra to give them just a bit of a better chance with 11 needed going into the last over.  The tables turned in the final over when Bangladesh blinked.  India stayed in the hunt and managed to pull of the heist. A hard fought prized out win.  Bangladesh despite losing clearly showed they could beat any of the sides on their day .  India needs to solve the top order puzzle to  stay in the hunt.  Rahane for Dhawan or Yuvraj will give them the stability they badly need .

@reymsterio7 &amp; img_sl. Dhoni's  excellent captaincy, planning &amp; the pressure of the situation caused the brain fades among the BD batsmen - both who are match winners on their own (so overall chain reaction). To win from the brink of defeat is something special. So definite credit to captain cool. Though if you look at winning mini battles, BD won most of them compared to the Indians. The only difference was India landed the very surprising final knockout punch with flattened BD. Amazing contest!

Too much defensive cricket hurting India at the top of the order... Dhawan has no confidence in himself.... Rohit also failing to give good start.... Raina not playing to is potential... All those added to India batting headaches.... Every time we can't depand on virat....

That's Right.. Bangladesh have lost this match... Bangladesh got firing top 3 batsmen.. good strike rate.. at last 3 balls they lost match.. over all good batting performance by Bangladesh up to 16 overs... but what about Indian top 3 batsmen... come on India this is not test match.. Actually our strength is not batting either not bowling.. Indian Real strength is One &amp; Only Captain Ms Dhoni...

It was Bangladesh who lost the match and India did not win it..... Dhoni is trying to cover up for the mistakes committed  by the players by claiming the chaos management, etc., BEWARE! this would not happen with any other team in the international arena. Even Bangladesh team would have become wiser now. On the same consideration, it is better to become wiser and avoid making the silly mistakes in the field whether batting, bowling or fielding.

Dont say it is luck that India wins. We dropped few catches also. Shall we say that Bangladesh is lucky , if those catches was not dropped they would have been bowled out convincingly. So if you think last three balls is a luck for India, then dropped catches by a better fielding team is a luck for Bangladesh. So dont take credits from Indians. they fought hard. Enjoy the win. Hats off to Captain cool.

India got lucky. BD had a brain freeze in the last 3 balls. (you can also call it a mini-choke) Dhoni got out-thought and out-captained by Mashrafe (just like Williamson). India is the best team only on a good pitch (which doesn't offer seam or too much spin). Indian batting has 4 flat track bullys (Rohit, Shikhar, Yuvraj and Raina) in its top 6 who have almost always failed when there is quality seam, swing or spin. Next World Cup I don't want to see any of those 4 except Rohit (at least he plays the short fast ball well) in this team. Any 3 out of Shreyas Iyer, Karun Nair, Manish Pandey, Jay Bista, Unmukt Chand, Sarfaraz Khan and Vijay Shankar to replace Shikhar, Yuvraj and Raina.

@JAYZUZ, did you even watch the full game or are you just conveniently forgetting the dropped catches and poor fielding (by their own standards) of Indians that allowed BD to take it this far? Had Bumarah/Nehra and Ash held on to those chances, the game was as good as over well before that final over!
India would win 100 out of 100 times against BD in these situations and THAT's the truth!

Dhoni deserves a praise for his wicketkeeping but he definitely doesn't deserve one for captaincy. He simply didn't use his bowlers well on this turner. Just 1 over from Raina even when he took wicket and none from Yuvraj is illogical. There is no way Pandya should have bowled 3 overs. It's the brain freeze from B'desh and intelligent wicketkeeping that won the match for India. I will any day prefer Kohli as captain and retain Dhoni as keeper.

Totally agree with JAYZUZ. It was not his planning that did the trick; it was BD player's foolishness. Any experienced player will poke the ball inside circle and take a single in a situation like this. BD players could not keep their brain working because of pressure situation; not because of MSD's planning. Anyway, history is always written by the winning side. So let him enjoy as long as fans listening.

Jayzuz and all of u who agree with him, managing and handling pressure is the key. Whether it's cricket or inlife. It may look simple or lucky as the other side caved in pressure. And 99 out of 100 times in pressure situations it's only the team or person who handles the pressure well wins. It's same when Javed mindad hit last ball 6 of chetan sharma.

It is not managing something properly is the key, but the poor shot selection of BD players won the match for mahendra. As usual he thinks he has done the planning and execution, but it is not you at all. It is BDs' who made you winners. LOL

Most of the credit for this win should go to Dhoni. A spectacular stumping and a brilliant runout on the last ball. The captain has ice in his veins.
</p>
<p>
I was stunned at the result. India played poor cricket in my opinion but still came out on tops. I think the team has now turned a corner, under Dhoni's able leadership. This performance reminds me so much of a great team like Australia. Give them an inch and they will claw back and surprise you. With a good pipeline of players and Dravid overseeing them, the future of Indian cricket has never looked more bright.

I think it was a master stroke to keep one over out and keep extending his best bowlers until they bowled out. Poor opening bowling worries me so much ! Rather than Bumrah, I think Dhoni should operate with Ashwin and Nehra to open the innings up.

@ JAYZUZ India are the best T20 side. They are 10-1 this year in T20 matches. Part of the reason for india's success is the ability to come out of pressure cooker situations and win. The best team in the world did that once more. That's what it is and not luck.

Like he always points out, if the plan is executed properly, the media goes all praises, but if it fails, then it's all chaos. Probably this knowledge of the media outburst helps him to ignore and execute his plans accordingly with no pressure. Keep doing this as long as we can find some body to carry the torch.

bringing on Ashwin in 12th over was a master stroke. Dhoni is definitely back to his old self and proactive attacking like he did today was key to the win. he still is too formulaic with his team selection. india need to bring on Rahane instead of either shikhar or yuvraj. more like shikhar to give depth and stability to batting....

Smart Dhoni, keeping the focus on bowlers. India was in this position due to abysmal batting. The Bangladesh team bowled superbly, still none of the Indian batsmen looked confident except Kohli.  Super win, but tougher days ahead.

Managing chaos! Dhoni makes it sound like he can take credit for Bangladesh's incredibly terrible performance in the last three balls. The second last ball was a juicy full toss! The third last a long hop. Did Dhoni make the batsman hit them straight to a fielder? Incredible powers of telekinesis! The truth is the over was awful. India got lucky, two simple catches and a simple run out in the last three balls thanks to a totally inept attempt display by the batting side. I hav never seen a team simply fall over at the finish line like that, as if programmed to lose. They clearly did not believe they could win, and self-destructed. India would have lost 99 times out of 100 if this had been any team but Bangladesh. And that is the truth.

Mushfiq should learn to let his bat do most of the talking. Two things I did like in the last game. 1. Bringing in Mash early. Even though he only had hit one 6 playing just one ball... even that was important.  Keeping the momentum of run rate is more critical than saving a wicket in this high paced game. When I saw come to bat in that spot, I felt, in that that moment in time that he would just change the course of the game single-handedly all by himself. It didn't happen but it was a great gamble, in my opinion. I wonder if others felt that way as well. 2. Keeping Sarker lower down the order was a good move and and a good back-up reserve ammunision given his form not quite clicking or up to the mark. I think this new continuously changing conditions has a lot to do with it though... not his form.

BD should think about next game , they should prepare for NZ clash forget about this performance and prepare for Eden pitch , same tactics , want to see more home work and  like to see Nasir instead of Holm.  give more chance to your proven smart and brave player.  and remember plan more  for last 4 over.  al amin is  not a depth bowler , no one member that al amin cost 17 runs at the 18 over , that cost BD this match , India should not score more that 140 in this match.  if BD can apply similar strategy i think  Nz will find it tough and i am sure that they can not read Mustafiz at all.

It did seem that India wanted to loose, so, they dropped 4 catches and few edges for bangladesh which otherwise wouldn't have fetched even a single.  It was India's match all through.

It can only take a great team to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.No if's &amp; but's and if we use these theories then only can say if certain catches against Ban were taken,they could have easily been bowled out.One of the greatest win this WC has seen.The Ind fans were taken from a point of dissolation to utter elation and the reverse can be said of the Ban fans.Thats the diff bet. the sides.

Well, India were certainly lucky to win the match. One can argue about the bastman's behavior, his cool headness, etc. Any other time, they would have taken those two runs. This just wasn't their day. This had nothing to do with the bowling quality or exceptional skills of Dhoni or anything like that. It was just pure luck. Not to belittle Dhoni, who I think is a great limited over captain and player. But this was just a miracle.

Mashrafe is wrong in saying that they 'played well at nearly every moment'. They played poorly and were allowed to get within touching distance because India was awful on the field. 4 dropped catches is just pathetic and Bangladesh not winning even after that kind of benevolence is even more pathetic. 
"Leave out the last three balls, we played brilliantly", is like saying - I studied diligently everyday for 11 months, but leave out the examination part, which I failed.

Here most of you forgetting one stat. in all t20i played on the ground 11 out of 12 were won by team batting second.  in this match Bangladesh won the toss and chose to field. India broke the trend. and still these Bangla fans think India was lucky.

Mushfiq should learn to let his bat do most of the talking. Two things I did like in the last game. 1. Bringing in Mash early. Even though he only had hit one 6 playing just one ball... even that was important.  Keeping the momentum of run rate is more critical than saving a wicket in this high paced game. When I saw come to bat in that spot, I felt, in that that moment in time that he would just change the course of the game single-handedly all by himself. It didn't happen but it was a great gamble, in my opinion. I wonder if others felt that way as well. 2. Keeping Sarker lower down the order was a good move and and a good back-up reserve ammunision given his form not quite clicking or up to the mark. I think this new continuously changing conditions has a lot to do with it though... not his form.

BD should think about next game , they should prepare for NZ clash forget about this performance and prepare for Eden pitch , same tactics , want to see more home work and  like to see Nasir instead of Holm.  give more chance to your proven smart and brave player.  and remember plan more  for last 4 over.  al amin is  not a depth bowler , no one member that al amin cost 17 runs at the 18 over , that cost BD this match , India should not score more that 140 in this match.  if BD can apply similar strategy i think  Nz will find it tough and i am sure that they can not read Mustafiz at all.

It did seem that India wanted to loose, so, they dropped 4 catches and few edges for bangladesh which otherwise wouldn't have fetched even a single.  It was India's match all through.

It can only take a great team to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.No if's &amp; but's and if we use these theories then only can say if certain catches against Ban were taken,they could have easily been bowled out.One of the greatest win this WC has seen.The Ind fans were taken from a point of dissolation to utter elation and the reverse can be said of the Ban fans.Thats the diff bet. the sides.

Well, India were certainly lucky to win the match. One can argue about the bastman's behavior, his cool headness, etc. Any other time, they would have taken those two runs. This just wasn't their day. This had nothing to do with the bowling quality or exceptional skills of Dhoni or anything like that. It was just pure luck. Not to belittle Dhoni, who I think is a great limited over captain and player. But this was just a miracle.

Mashrafe is wrong in saying that they 'played well at nearly every moment'. They played poorly and were allowed to get within touching distance because India was awful on the field. 4 dropped catches is just pathetic and Bangladesh not winning even after that kind of benevolence is even more pathetic. 
"Leave out the last three balls, we played brilliantly", is like saying - I studied diligently everyday for 11 months, but leave out the examination part, which I failed.

Finally little appreciation from BD captain is Good !!! ,They played really well in all 3 games and yday's match bowling and fielding were excellent but in the end tough loss for them. Bangladesh team and their spirit but always hurting with their attitude, behavior and body language in the field BD needs to go long way..!!

As a fan of cricket I still like Bangladesh team and their spirit but always hurting with their attitude, behavior and body language. I can still expect their comments or behavior if Bangladesh won this match. Mushi never learnt lessons from past. Still remember when india travelled to Bangladesh he told that it is India A team. even though he lost that series. But, not learnt from past.

It is very sad that luck factor has come into India's victory. Luck was compensated in the end. BD was given so many chances including catch drops by Indian fielders. BD was given everything but BD couldn't utilize them. They just didn't respect India. They wanted to show the attitude of world champion by hitting big shots when not required. That too from experienced BD players and where do you see bad luck for BD here? It was BD's obvious blunders which costed the victory. Dhoni with his cool mind tried his best to get last 3 wickets. He even was ready with one glove to run out the last batsman. Things worked out for him in the end.

I Love Mashrafe. This man had so many injuries and still coming back and playing competitive Cricket. In America, he is like Richard Nixon who kept coming back.
Bangladesh played well; a really inspiring game. But as they say "Luck always favors the brave" Dhoni's conniving tactics and sly moves finally choked the Bangladeshis.
I can only say that both parties won.

And I feel Mushfiq was not the wrong doer. Adrenaline got better of him and he  just backed himself to go for a big shot. Mahmudullah should have batted sensibly when Mushfiq got out. He too played the same shot and nobody said about that. That was the turning point of the match. He could have flicked that full toss along the ground for at least a single rather than hitting it near the vicinity of the best fielder in world cricket ( Jadeja )

I did not watch the match. Just heard that India won with luck and Bangladesh had caught India by their throat. Saw the highlights now. The batting was pretty ordinary from India. Bangladesh did well in fielding and bowling. But India themselves made into such a pressure situation. India dropped 4 catches ( Ashish, Bumrah, Ashwin and Dhoni ). India would have won it easily if  3 of those catches were taken. So it was not an authoritative display of Bangladeshi power for 237 balls. May be 180 balls. It was just the shoddy fielding of India that made Bangladesh in a better position. But should agree that last 3 overs were see-saw ride. And last over was a master piece. Dhoni, Jadeja and Pandya done it for India at the last.

This was almost a deja-vu situation as in the first T20 finals in 2007.  Misbah ul Haq has taken Pakistan to the verge of victory with sixes galore in a low scoring match. Towards the last over he had a brain freeze while playing with the 10th batsman and did a reverse Dil-scoop that was gobbled up by Sreesanth behind to hand India that first World T20 title.

Even as an Indian, it was heart-breaking to see Bangladesh lose this one after getting so close. India played really poor cricket for the most part (with 3 dropped catches, average batting, inconsistent fielding), and only played superlatively those last three balls, especially the ice-cool Dhoni.
As such, B'desh deserved to win that game and cause the biggest of upsets.  Till India pulls up their game in all aspects, batting, bowling and even fielding, they will not win the 2016 trophy.

Good fight back from India. They are capable of normal game under pressure situations. But it's nothing of tactics from India at last over rather than early celebration by Rahim and over excited Mahamudulla. If you couldn't stop 2 boundaries in 2nd &amp; 3rd overs had you an early plan to stop in next 3 balls.

Even Indian cricketers of past helped Bangladeshi cricketers n encouraged them. Mushfiqur's premature celebration in front of an young Pandya showed d grudge they have on India. At the end the team kept it's head cool won.

I just don't get why there weren't any meetings between Mushy-Mullah, Mullah-Hom, Hom-Mustafiz. No ONE talked out there for Bangladesh. While India discussed and covered all the possible scenarios! If Mushy and Mullah discussed, surely they would've been a little more calculative and little more aware of the scoreboard. 2 from 3, no need for air ball!

Bangladesh lost the match because they were more concerned in beating India than winning the match. You should never celebrate unless you complete the last hurdle, two fours on the trot and Mushfiqur Rahim was on the moon, he forgot the basics and   senseless in skewing the ball, Mahmudallah too followed him, rest is history. Overall Bangladesh played well, they are good team but they need to calm their emotions. Indian fielding was shoddy and was mainly responsible for bringing the match this close. India has now played three matches on turners, this sort of wicket seems to be following them where ever they go. They are still long away from mastering their skill to play on turning tracks. Hope the last match too does not turn out to be on a turner.

BD  did not  show  what they are capable off due to their poor choice of new comer in this format.   for what reason they tried too much with Shuvagoto and mithun and others. i have no clue , instead of trying with them they should give more opportunity to promising players like liton, Bijoy whos average is very good and Nasir, BD should try with them more  and let them settle,  what mithun did for Yesterday , i am sure  that nasir could do better if you would try with him as a opener. and i also do not understand al amin not being a depth bowler bowled 19 over and cost 17 runs, what Shuvagoto did, while ball was moving he got a lucky wicket in a miss hit cost 11 runs cost in 16th over. BD must find a depth bowler in this format, if someone can not bowl a yourker he should not try. run rate was very much with in BDs hand but still they look for big hit, tamim can wait  a little bit more,. BDs coach is a master tactician but his choice of players are not promising.

It was India's poor fielding and selection of wrong bowlers give the impression that BD would have won. How can you prefer Pandya over Raina or Yuvaraj on a slow / turining pitch! Fielding wasn't good either - lost 3-4 catches including a sitter by Bumrah.

Bangladesh must learn to control there emotions. They have all the ingredients in place. In Shakib they have one of worlds premium all rounder, in Tamim a fantastic opener, in Mustafizur a young protegee and very good captain in Mushrafe. But one gets a feeling that the suspension of Sunny and Taskin was playing in their mind. In a way it looked like they were playing to avenge what has been unjustly timed suspension of their bowlers. In a pressure game emotions like anger and revenge can play havoc with your cold and calculated logic. Bangla boys will learn from this defeat. But no doubt this defeat will haunt them for long time. It will test all their resolve and mantle toughness to get out of this defeat.

Bangladesh played really well and when the last over began.. I was already thinking about the drop catches and misfields. But all got compensated in the last three balls.. all the poor fielding in the initial overs were forgotten.  India should have yuvi at 4, because he needs a few balls to get in..

For those saying India got lucky, i believe the game reached where it did thanks to the worst fielding performance dished out by India in the past 10-12 games. So BD were also lucky by same measure. Else on this pitch India would normally have closed out the game much earlier.

For those saying India got lucky, i believe the game reached where it did thanks to the worst fielding performance dished out by India in the past 10-12 games. So BD were also lucky by same measure. Else on this pitch India would normally have closed out the game much earlier.

<p>
India got lucky. BD had a brain freeze in the last 3 balls. (you can also call it a mini-choke) Dhoni got out-thought and out-captained by Mashrafe (just like Williamson). India is the best team only on a good pitch (which doesn't offer seam or too much spin). Indian batting has 4 flat track bullys (Rohit, Shikhar, Yuvraj and Raina) in its top 6 who have almost always failed when there is quality seam, swing or spin. Next World Cup I don't want to see any of those 4 except Rohit (at least he plays the short fast ball well) in this team. Any 3 out of Shreyas Iyer, Karun Nair, Manish Pandey, Jay Bista, Unmukt Chand, Sarfaraz Khan and Vijay Shankar to replace Shikhar, Yuvraj and Raina.

In my 40 years of cricket watching, I have not seen such a dumb decision by two experienced batsmen of BD. It was impossible to comprehend that they would not place the ball and take a single to label the score. Is there another example of such situation? As long as BD players will not know how to manage such situation, they will not win, They gave away a tough game in two balls at the end.

Mushy should have played more sensibly. He is a pro and has been in the team forever. This win would have done Bd a world of good. Now we have zero points; all losses. A single was what he should have gone for. You don't have to do it in style always. Its the victory at the end that matters. Both he and his brother-in-law let the team down, the fans down, the country down. Shame on them both.

Seriously don't understand.. why are you guys criticzing yuvraj?!! He save at least 10 runs in the match and he had only one off day. Instead, Dhawan proved his mediocrity as a dashing opener again. Get Iyer for Dhawan. And why not Raina? Hes like the Maxwell of India 10 matches 1 hit rest miss.

BD has of late become like Pakistan - their main aim seems to be beating India. They have been taking things emotionally and personally. They are very good side and they will win world cups for sure. But they must respect the opposition. Please do not blame the Indian players or fans or BCCI for everything. Had Mushfiquir Rehaman concentrated on winning rather than directing his behavior to India, BD would have won easily. Why do people love WI? They always behave well win or lose. BD win over the Indian fans first. You have a fine side - maybe better than India in some aspects but you do not need to feel victimized. Whatever happened in the past (like big 3) is due to some other person. Now Sashank Manohar seems a sensible and fair man. Also Dalmiya was key to BD getting test match status. So respect the other players, country, and people. BD should have won yesterday and they have only their own behavior to blame. Feels horrible but it happens and ICC or India or BCCI is not at fault

I don't forsee any good future for BD like everybody is saying. Their attitude needs to be changed. They need to be more matured and professional. BD has been playing since some years. But they need to prove a lot before feeling like champions. BD had lost all 4 matches here and in some of them luck had favored them a lot as did in this match. But they still feel that they should have won all the matches. I have never seen this kind of attitude in any country. This attitude is different from "not losing confidence.".

India has to sort out batting order particularly Yuvraj's place.  Bangladesh was in a way lucky, that some catches were dropped.  This is how big teams come back strongly.  Give them an inch, they take the whole place.  Rahim gave us some home and before Bangladesh winked their eyes, everything was over.  
</p>

Full marks to my man of the match Dhoni for the way he effected two stumpings and one run out.   One stumping, he manufactured.

<p>
This is how Australia has been playing across sports like Cricket or Hockey.  They do not give up till official scorer announces that the match is over.  India did the same thing.

BD you did very well. I always thought you had good chance of winning. Restricting India to 146 was very good. India had gone through such heartbreaks before. So, pick yourself up and do good against NZ. One thing though. BD fans are not getting good name from veteran Indian fans due to their behaviour. Which is one reason you will not see appreciation for your team's efforts and game. I hope all these things will change.

Its rather Bangladesh losing the match than India winning it. It was really an ideal time for BD to win against India in India but they spoilt the chance by going for glory shot when singles were the order of the day. BD winning the match could have opened the group. Now its simple for India, win the next match and proceed to Semis.

Well Played Bangladesh, your team really deserved the win but now card are on opposite side. I have to admire that your team basically outplayed India in every aspect of the game for most of the times. The only issue was handling the pressure under crunch situation and the art of finishing with a cool head. The last over was a hell-out, i doubt Pandya ever got so many suggestion in his short cricketing career. Dhoni as always was the difference between the two teams. One side he stays so firm &amp; calm but on other side he is super electric behind the stumps. India still not in the assured SF seat which makes AUS-IND encounter a do or die match. Come-on India #BleedBlue on 27th

Everything was well? how ? India dropped 4 catches. There was hue and cry over Shakib dropping Rohit recently. why not now? Bangladesh had more luck with slogs going for fours.  India bowled pretty well  and took it to the last over despite the drop chances. only Pandya was bad. Yes, BD were better in the field but the openers had a good partnership too and 147 was a par score on that gripping pitch.

Bangladesh Tigers, that was a terrific performance. Bowling, Fielding and Batting till the last 3 bowlers was a great display. Very good captaincy for the lines bowled and field set. India prevailed, due to experience. This will be a great learning for the BD team and there will be better days.

It is unfair and some what sadistic and stupid question to ask the losing captain of this extraordinary match 'do you have any plans moving forward to fix this?'.   What plans the reporter expects within few hours after the end of the match? And why should such plan be shared. This is a fast growing team and they will reach higher levels of cricket standards very soon. Give them some rest if not encouragement.

The players do themselves no good by dwelling in this loss. Take comfort from the fact that you dominated a strong Indian side in their home turf for almost the entire length of the match. Even with a depleted bowling attack, you kept the mighty Indian batting at bay. There will be many more matches to play and many more to win. As a Bangladeshi, I am proud of the fight and courage this team is showing over and over again. Keep it up, we will get them next time.

There wasnt any chance really for Bangladesh to go through. Maybe they wanted India to go through as they didnt want the host nation to fall for an early exit. 2 off 3 balls, you tell me.

Dhoni played it smart. His intention was clear, out or just one, so you still have a chance in the super over. He wanted to avoid the deflection of the stumps earlier, when Pandya threw and cost India two runs. That woud be the end of the world cup.

Dhoni's dash to the wicket off the last ball was incredible, given the situation and impending result. The reason BD team lost the match was due to their over confidence to knock-off in GRAND STYLE the 2 runs required in 3 balls. BAD execution plan by BD team.

Mustafizur Rahman was standing at the non striker end when the last ball was delivered: 19 meters from the stumps, with the bat and hand extension giving him a 1.5 meter advantage: 17.5 meters from the stumps.
When Pandya bowled, Mustafir had already left the crease and when the ball reached Dhoni's hands, he was already half way down the pitch: 10 metres.
Now it was a battle between Dhoni at 13 meters from the stumps (who had to start running) and Mustafir who was 10 meters away from the stumps with the added advantage of 2 meters (extended bat): 8 meters (who was already running in full throttle). Mustafir had a 5 meter advantage.
No other wicket keeper in the world would have tried to run all the way to the stumps considering the fresh fast legs of Mustafir. Some might have thrown the ball at the stumps. Dhoni tried to do the unthinkable. He tried to do the impossible. He took on.
Dhoni covered the 13 meter distance in 2 seconds (A start that Ussain Bolt would be proud of). History.

Just like always, Dhoni is making up plans after the occurrence of an event.  The truth of the matter is all the deliveries in the last over were awful and yet the Bangladesh players couldn't win the game when and gave it on a platter to India. Why are people  praising Dhoni's captaincy? His Captaincy has been very poor in recent times. He was never a good Test Captain and he does not have great plans. Dhoni himself has created this great captain legacy to his name (not by coming up with or executing great plans on the field) by boasting about his own great plans is post match speeches. What he does is look back at what happened (if India wins) and say that his plan was to do exactly what happened and some people are naive enough to believe that. Most of his decisions in this match were very poor; most of all he should never have given the inexperienced Pandya the final over. It was not the bowling nor the captaincy that won the game for India, Bangla needed 2 singles, not 2 sixes!!!

India would have qualified even with a tie with Bangladesh (I think there is no super over for group matches) if they beat Australia. Then Aus/Pak would not qualify as they would be on 4 points max. Simple equation for India is to win the next match (in fact, next 3 matches to win T20 WC).

What India would want is Pakistan to beat Australia (or it to be a rain-induced abandonment) so that even if there is a rain induced abandonment in India vs Aus still India will qualify. If it doesn't rain then India has to beat Australia to qualify anyway (given India's bad net run-rate). And the best India can hope for is 2nd position in the table as NZ need to lose badly to Bangladesh and India to win massively against Australia (extremely unlikely both occurring together).

Just like always, Dhoni is making up plans after the occurrence of an event.  The truth of the matter is all the deliveries in the last over were awful and yet the Bangladesh players couldn't win the game when and gave it on a platter to India. Why are people  praising Dhoni's captaincy? His Captaincy has been very poor in recent times. He was never a good Test Captain and he does not have great plans. Dhoni himself has created this great captain legacy to his name (not by coming up with or executing great plans on the field) by boasting about his own great plans is post match speeches. What he does is look back at what happened (if India wins) and say that his plan was to do exactly what happened and some people are naive enough to believe that. Most of his decisions in this match were very poor; most of all he should never have given the inexperienced Pandya the final over. It was not the bowling nor the captaincy that won the game for India, Bangla needed 2 singles, not 2 sixes!!!

India would have qualified even with a tie with Bangladesh (I think there is no super over for group matches) if they beat Australia. Then Aus/Pak would not qualify as they would be on 4 points max. Simple equation for India is to win the next match (in fact, next 3 matches to win T20 WC).

What India would want is Pakistan to beat Australia (or it to be a rain-induced abandonment) so that even if there is a rain induced abandonment in India vs Aus still India will qualify. If it doesn't rain then India has to beat Australia to qualify anyway (given India's bad net run-rate). And the best India can hope for is 2nd position in the table as NZ need to lose badly to Bangladesh and India to win massively against Australia (extremely unlikely both occurring together).

This match reminds me of the Brisbane tie between Australia &amp; WI in 1960. Kudos to Young Pandya for keeping his cool in delivering the last ball as planned &amp; for MSD to pull off the heist with sprinting to break the wkt. I was amazed that Pandya was dealt the task of bowling the 20th over!India has been extremely lucky in all their matches so far to come back from losing position to win except vs. NZ. This match only proved once more that so far NZ is the only team which marched effortlessly to Win their matches. India has to win vs. the Aussies to keep their WC hopes alive. I have said this before- this Indian team needs at least one more specialist batsman @#4. They are relying on luck knowing this to be their need. So it is matter of luck running out on them or staying with them that kept India still in the hunt. Will MSD &amp; India make the change or pin their hopes on Luck &amp; Kohli!

MSD captaincy is poor so far in this world cup... In turning tracks he doesn't used yuvraj n raina properly... N hardhik pandhya is not a bowler who can bowl in backend of an innings.he will be good in middle overs....n please for God sake throw dhawan out of the team. He is useless...we doesn't need a player who plays one innings n fails next 10 games... Backing a player who repeatingly fails doesn't do justice for guys who doing well in domestic games. N finally picking playing eleven by seeing conditions n pitch is better instead of dumbly sticking to same eleven each n every match.

Bangladesh Last because of the following Reasons,
1. Excellent running Catch by Jadeja in the Second last ball of the match
2. A good ball by Pandiya at the last ball
3. Dhoni removing the gloves and keeping himself ready for a run out
4.  Beyond all Greediness of Bangala player to win the match like Dhoni did in Asia cup, this proves all keeper and finishers cannot be Dhoni to hit a six and win the match.

Actually, Dhoni should have not left Pandya for the last over. He must have tried to squeeze an over or two from Yuvraj. He had an opportunity when they had Bang for 80 odd for 5, right after Ashwin took out Sakib. He could have asked Yuvraj to bowl an over then. It would have given him a cushion of an extra over from Nehra/Bumrah....but it is all in hindsight now. Dhoni has this habit of taking it deep and throwing the most inexperienced bowler into the deep end. Truth be told, Pandya bowled an awful last over which deserved to be trashed but Bang imploded spectacularly and Pandya is now a hero....strange are the ways of cricket.

@HAMMADFAYYAZ:- You are absoulely wrong. Out of the last 3 balls only one was a low full toss that was caught in deep. Low fulltoss are tough to hit with power for a six. One needs to time them for six.  But the batsman tried to slog that ball.  The ball that got Mustafiz was a good length ball that hurried on him and was not short enough to pull.  He played a bad shot.  The final ball is Pandyas strength, like Dhoni said short ball that is muscled and hit the deck hard.  See you might think these are easy balls but for that bowler (pandiya here) those balls were his best delieveries that he can bowl to cause some difficulties to bats man.  The last ball and the 4th ball were gem of the deliveries under pressure to win India the match.

This Indian win is because of pure madness by BD players. May be they wanted to take a revenge on MSD's Asia cup final blitz. Mushfiqur wanted to finish with a six like the way MSD did to them in Asia cup final, which paved the way for Indian win. Pandya's only one good  delivery was the last one. Looks like MSD's brain worked only for the last delivery. Even after the win I am not happy with the way he is handling Yuvi. Sending Pandya ahead of Yuvi was real madness. And not using him as bowler on turing wickets was hard to understand. I am MSD's fan. But I am not happy with the way he is dealing with our champion batsman also a handy bowler Yuvaraj Singh.   The way in which the so-called WC favourites are progressing is not convincing at all because of poor captaincy by MSD. Evenafter this India qualifies and perhaps wins the cup it will be purely by LUCK. So God bless this Indian captain with lot of luck.

I respect MS Dhoni, but in the last over, I dont think any tactics from Indian team worked for their win. Its just the BD players that faulted. The last 3 balls were from HP were terrible to say the least. 2 full tosses and last one was length and was "in the zone" to be hit. It was just a wish to go for glamour that lead BD to this result. Nothing else!

Ashwin has a great cricketing brain. He knows exactly what the batsman is likely to do and what delivery to bowl to which batsman. He'd make a good captain IMO.

My prediction after this boosting victory India will defeat Australia without any doubt. Luck is also favouring them. Three cheers

Indian bowlers were fabulous in the last part of the match,especially Jasprit Bumrah who restricted Bangladesh to make only six runs in the second last over.However Bangladesh were really poor in the last overs.You needed only 2 runs from 3 balls, you had two of the real batsmen on the crease and you still fail.India had barely any fielder in the circle except of two on the slip and you still attempt for a boundary rather than a single. Mushfiqur Rahim made a mistake in attempting a boundary so Mahmudullah should have learned from his mistake and should not have attempted for a boundary.Actually Hardik Pandya's full toss developed a greed for a boundary and Bangladesh made mistakes.These blunders actually makes people think of the match to fixed.However the match was wonderful but is not a good sign for India as they had to struggle a lot to win from Bangladesh.Defeating Australia will be difficu;t for India as they are far more better than Bangladesh.

Comparing to all other teams Indian top 3 batsmen make runs but with lower strike rate... and this is the issue with Indians because upcoming batsmen(Raina,Dhoni&amp;Yuvraj) don't get enough balls to settle and  force to go for big shots right from 1st ball which is very tough.&amp; top orders(Rohit,Kolhi,Dhawan) only making their runs but loosing the match... About 2nd innings Last ball was according to plan but Dhoni is one step forward than all cricketers.. Dhoni removed his gloves before the last ball.. this prove how much Dhoni is needed in future for India.. that's why Dhoni is greatest captain in the world..

Happy that India had pulled this match. I would  say India's performance is not up to the mark in the field ( bad bowling, poor fielding) rather than saying bangladesh were lucky.  They failed to capitalize their moments . 2runs from 3balls and you loose by 1 run, it doesn't happen often.

@impact92, Dhoni has never taken credit for a victory. Every time he receives the winners trophy, he gives it to the team. India have not had such captain till he came in. A classic captain for years to come.
As somebody else mentioned, BD were quite lucky to have edges go to boundary, yorkers played awkwardly go for singles, catches dropped which is not usual with this Indian team.

India are playing like classic champions.You play really poor till knockouts,somehow get into semis.And then peak when it really matters.Only Aussies have defied this theory in 2003 and 2015 WC.But this is how India got into super 6 in 2007 World T20.NZ have peaked too early and are more likely to stumble.1 more win,no NRR worry.

BD got all the luck till the last over. Edges went for four , miss timed pulls went for six, three four catches dropped, LBWs not given....but at the last over, their luck ran out just because immature celebration from Mushfiqur Rahim after hitting four. God think thats enough rest of that is history.

India is not batting well. The pitches may not have helped but 147 is too low. 
The credit for this win actually should go to Bumrah who brought back India into the game with his perfectly bowled yorkers. He may have slipped up during fielding but his bowling in his last two overs were immaculate. 
With this kind of batting though, it will be tough to go through.

Roller coaster ride of a match. Indian batting unit need to improve if to even have a chance against Australia and to go further in this tournament.. But good overall performance. Bhumrah with his yorkers, Ashwin and Jadeja with their spin and control, Dhoni's sprint that gave India one extra run last ball of India's innings and a wicket last ball of Bangladesh Innings..

Mirror time. Team India batting should know what it is when Virat doesnt perform. unbelievable luck for pandya/India to get those 2 wickets(caught) off rubbish balls after the two boundaries. Time to get in Rahane for Yuvi so that Raina can play at #5 as he looks completely out of touch at #4(just cant imagine Raina role as building innings). Why is Dhoni coming in so late when he is such good knick(better than yuvi/raina/)? and when can we get a replacement for Dhawan. for gods sake two performing right handers as openers is better than non performing left/right combo

All credits to bangladesh for restricting india under 150, their field placement were excellent. After coming to bat also bangladesh took the control, it was their game until the last 3 balls. Only experince took india home along with a must accepted factor called luck. This world cup being played in India and it is surprising that India is most struggling team among the top 4 or 5. When it comes to the batsmen, Only Kohli, Dhoni and Rohit deserves to be in the playing XI. Dhawan, Raina and Yuvraj are running down throuhg the patience of millions of indian fans.

Now people should realise how crucial it was for MS Dhoni and Ashwin to run the 2nd in the last ball of the innings. MS Dhoni is a true genius! Ashwin didn't want to run the 2nd but Dhoni pushed him and that is what made the difference!

Continue from previous post....then why can't he convert those achievements into performance. Raina and Dhawan are of the same category of player who will perform 1 out of 365 days. Should had got Manish Pandey to reward his brilliant match winning innings in Australia. Cannot understand the plot at all with Dhoni and rest of the team management. Hope everyone has the same strong desire as me to win this world cup. The group stage is getting tight won't get a second chance dear Dhoni, hope you realize this sooner than later.

Somebody please explain Dhoni that this last ball plan does not work always. In early stages of a big tournaments you have to nail it not dragging it till the last ball. This can be achieved if he gives up his stubborn nature of retaining the same team regardless of pitch conditions and opposition. Don't understand why Raina and Dhawan are still in playing 11 if we can get some one who can together contribute a quick 40-50 runs that will make a huge difference if games like this. Learn from New Zealand how they modify their team depending on conditions. Look at South Africa, how they have dropped Dale Steyn, their premier bowler against a relatively easy team like Afghanistan. South Africa teaches us, players should be selected on the basis on performance; not records and past history. Dhoni will defend Raina's selection by saying we don't have any players to replace Raina, Raina has played so many T20 games, he has scored century in all formats, he is this.. he is that...

Hardik Pandya has kept his nerve to bowl the perfect last ball and Dhoni should be given credit for making the run out.  It is not a better idea to give last over to Hardik Pandya in future. He is very inexperienced and it may be difficult to handle the pressure especially when bowling second. India now has to invariably win against Australia. India better knows the strengths and weaknesses of Australia than any other country, as they played against many players of Australia in the recent 3 match series. If Australia loses to Pakistan and if India Pakistan and Australia have same points, it will be very difficult to India to go through to the semi finals as our NRR is very poor. Hence we should look for straight win against Australia.

When you have a turning pitch like that sqeezing two or three by part timers isn't unknown to the captains these days. gotta admire mortaza's field placement for kohli and dhoni. That itself saved them at least 10-15 runs.

Good over?  He was carted for 2 fours and what would have been a wide if the batsmen left it.  Full toss should have been put out of the stadium and a stronger batsmen would have sent that into downtown MG Road in Bangalore!  
Suddenly this Team who were favorites are looking very vulnerable.  Dahwan is woefully out of touch, Rohit can't bat on any pitch that is not perfect for batting, Raina and Yuvraj are suspect (as if we did not already know that) and the team is 1 proper batsmen short.  Strategy is Dhoni-esqe once again with Harbajan and Negi sitting on the sidelines when clearly 3 spinners are needed. 
Aus vs India will determine who goes through.... Australia should account for this middling team. 
WI to win the comp.

Team composition is wrong. No doubt it is a good team won lot of matches. For Indian conditions, need to change the strategy. 
1. No power hitter in the power play
2. If wickets dumpling down,no one is there to stand till end
3. No reason why Yuvaraj n dhawan in the team. They neither hitter nor in form. struggling to get singles.
4. Replace dhawan with rahane to build partnership
5. Replace Yuvaraj with Pawan or Bhaji n promote him in the top middle order or even opening (pawan) as they are slog hitters
6. Replace Nehra with Shami or Bhajji
7. Bring down Raina batting order 
8. Batting sequence
   Rohit or Pawan 
   Rahane
   Kohli
   Dhoni
   Raina
   Rohit or Pawan/Bhajji
   Pandya
   Jadeja
   Ashwin
   Bumrah
   Shami

Why did it come to Pandya bowling the last over ? I think the strategy in using the bowlers requires a deeper introspection

India was extremely lucky to pull off this win. The team makeup is still not a winning combination. Sharma, Dhawan, Raina still have not delivered in spite of too many chances given to them. Nehra and Bumrah do not come across as matching bowlers and they are pretty weak in fielding.

India didn't win the game. Bangladesh handed it to India on a platter. It is Captain Cool's effort which made the Team India to get closer to the Semis while it was unbelievable loss to Bangladesh at the finishing point. The Team India shall work hard for the Cup in the remaining three games. I wish the Captain Cool and his boys all the best in remaining three matches.

India were lucky to win and should thank their lucky stars that Bangladesh succumbed to pressure in the closing stages of the match. There is a lot of work to be done and The think tank should decide if this is the best eleven to beat Australia and move onwards. If the present team is maintained and the batting does not have to depend on Virat or Dhoni a loss to Australia is imminent as Australia have a well balanced team and do not depend on just a couple of players. Perhaps Shastri should stop drinks soup and focus on how India can improve in all aspects of the game if they want to win the trophy.

Dhawan, Yuvraj, Nehra Out. Harbhajan, Negi, Shami In. Please. Get Pandya to open and be the aggressive opener that India Needs.  And swap Raina with Dhoni. Dhoni at 4. Raina at 5.

I like the way he was backing his players. He was very clear while talking. But in the end we were expecting a better show from Indian team especially against teams like BD.

Many mistakes prior to the last over.  Tamim scoring 16 runs in one over of Bhumrah after being dropped by Bhumrah!  Shakib scoring some vital shots after being dropped by Ashwin.
</p>
<p>
MSDs captaincy was superb in this match. His glove-work has been the best.  Stumping Shabbir was of high class.  He did not go out of the crease to hit but that few seconds his foot went off and finding that perfect time to connect the stumps got us the wicket. He removed one of his gloves to throw on to the stumps even before Pandya bowled!  He could have thrown on to the stumps from 15 meters but his confidence in running up to the stumps secured that run out!  His prompt thinking on crunch situation.  This is what MSD a totally different leader.
</p>
<p>
This Indian team brings energy on the field.  Pandya and Bhumrah are great finds for India.  Pandya can hit some sixes besides his electrifying fielding and his improvement as a bowler.  I predict Mumbai Indians will have great time in IPL 2016 with them.

Dhoni as usual just lucked out. He can say whatever after winning. His sticking to same 11 is very wrong which is what is making India such a weak team.  His bowling srategy of not using 3 spinners in the spinning tracks, not using yuvi's bowling are plain wrong. He wins IN SPITE OF that not BECAUSE OF that. When Ashwin &amp; Jadeja have conceded 4 rpo he goes with Pandya who went for 8 rpo. What can we say. Lets see how far his luck takes him.

Hardik Pandya's input and contribution in today's match was extraordinary! The fist catch he took, the way he fields, his quick fire runs and the last over! Incredible find he is for India. Reminds me of Kapil Dev. India needs a seemer who can bat and field. Well done India.

It will be another 150 pitch on Mohali again on Sunday against Australia,whoever bats first and scores 150 or more,will be difficult to chase for the other team.Thankfully for Indian fans,MS Dhoni has successfully defended many 130-140 scores in IPL with Chennai in the past,so he has a clear idea how to defend these under-par total on Indian pitches.Anyways,If they qualify for semis,their batsmen has to do the business as teams will come harder at their bowling and it will be difficult to contain teams like SA,Eng who are batting heavy and have a fearless approach which also comes with some skills.India live to fight for another day,but they have to be far more clinical in every department in their upcoming matches If they wish to win the WC on home soil.Only Kohli&amp;Dhoni has batted with some sense of responsibility in the 3 matches India played so far,but Rohit,Yuvraj,Raina has played lot of games for India&amp;IPL to be accustomed to the pressure&amp;conditions.There's only lack of execution.

Coming from an SL fan : Dhoni's calmness is incomparable even to any of 
the calmest of captains this game has produced, like, steve waugh, viv richards, 
Hansie cronje, Ranatunga etc. 
</p>
<p>
The way he said 'Out' after that last ball without too much emotion or spice shows 
what this man is upto. Fans of other countries (including my fella SL fans) should
just admire and enjoy such games, learn the life lesson of composure of players like 
Dhoni, instead of claiming 'luck' etc. 
</p>
<p>
Finally almost everyone is forgetting the role played by Nehra in this game. He
mentored every bowler and also guided Dhoni all the way through and that is why 
Dhoni respects him so much. 
</p>
<p>
Now its either India or Australia who will win this world cup from here

well...well....well...India finally managed to pull this off....Now, the post mortem comments of the match. Dhoni had a good game, a double run of his last ball while batting although while he did not get the big shot, a lucky or maybe presence of mind stumping in the middle and a smart run out of the last ball....ensured he kept the dreams of another world cup alive. that's what matters....execution and living up to expectations. From now on.... it's upto the others to pull up socks and put a better performances. Especially openers and Raina. We have ideally, 3 matches left to win the cup. come on India... Jithaa do....maybe this could be Dhoni's last T20 world cup. let's bring it home.

Final reading is India won the match,  remember we did win/tie one match in 2011 worldcup this way against England and from there wining the worldcup itself. May this match inspire the same in India and make the win this worldcup. After all teams in this big tournaments need big luck than great skill, it just reminds me of the 2011 worldcup.

Evidently, the reasons why Bangladesh lost: Our lack of the temperament and professionalism in finishing the job resulting in a lesser skilled Ban team. And, opponent's luck is an alibi to camouflage our pathetic temperament and poor presence of mind and focus, which are among the most important aspects of sport. Skills alone not enough; Shunn these shortcomings and be a force to recon. Plz pub.

Hello guys, I do not want to take any credit away from India. I have congerculate them from the botton of my heart for wining such a close match. However, i have looked into the scorecard of IND vs BAN (http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2016/engine/match/951353.html) and i have found this from my analysis. Please correct me what i am doing wrong. BD total runs should be 146. Please look the calculation below:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bowling runs calculation : Nehra 29 + Bumrah 32 + Ashwin 20 + Jadeja 22 + Pandya 29 + Raina 9 = Total 141  + Extras 5 = Total 146  (should be)

Shabbir was not out. Even though it was clear that he was in the air(both his legs) when dhoni took off the bails, his position on ground is supposed to be the last point of contact of his body or gear with the ground. And his last point of contact was inside the crease where he jumped of his back leg. This theory of last point of contact with the ground is used in many games like Basketball, handball, soccer and even cricket(where many player complete a catch by tossing the ball in air before going out of boundary and coming back inside the boundary touching the ground and catching the ball). 
</p>
<p>
Consider a situation when a batsman is running/standing well inside the crease and he jumps in the air and someone take off the bails. That ofc is NOTOUT. 
</p>
<p>
Of all the cases where player is given out because of his bat or leg being in the air is because some part of his body is touching the ground outside the crease so he is deemed to be outside the crease.

Well played Bangladesh and India. It was an exciting match, anything was possible in that match including a super over so as fans we should thank both teams for such an exciting game of cricket.

India won only due to "Divine Intervention" , looking back cannot find any reason why they won, agreed, Dhoni was fantastic but still it was Bangladesh's match to lose. India's batsmen need to step up, Aus vs Pak match, Aus were 60 for 3 and Steve Smith, Maxwell, and Watson accelerated the innings from the difficult position to 190+. Unfortunately, we have only Kohli who seems to be consistent. Last chance India, please do well. All the very best. Let the "Divine Intervention" continue... I still feel Harbajan will be difficult to handle for Aussies, they will probably handle Hardik easily, even though I love Hardik's lower order hitting.

well played team India. The next match is very important against Australia. As of now Top order except kohli has not shown good form. Dhawan and Rohit seem quite ordinary batsmen in three matches. So in the next match Rahane can be good replacement of Dhawan as Rahane is much better fielder than Dhawan. In middle order I think Yuvi should bat at no. 4 so that he can get more time in middle and Raina &amp; Pandya must be kept for situation when asking rate is high or to accelerate the run rate. Dhoni should keep himself as finishing role. Now come to bowling Team India should play one more spinner in place of pandaya according to pitch condition as It will give team more option if one spinner had a bad day. Summary is Rahane must be included in next match in place of Dhawan n one spinner can be added in playing XI in place of Pandaya If pitch condition allows.

This was what T20 is meant for. Nail biting finishes. And in last over it can happen. There are numerous examples from IPL. So, a match is not finished until it is finished. If BD had done it in an ODI, I would have called it that BD lost it. But, since it is a T20, I would say that India and in particular M S Dhoni won it. Why are people getting surprised here? That is a ROUTINE T20 STUFF. Great match though. It can never say whether BD is up there and improved, or India has declined. Its about handling the pressure, and play to the situation with quick thinking. India did that. Plain and simple. BD still need to do more to prove themselves.

Evidently, the reasons why Bangladesh lost: Our lack of the temperament and professionalism in finishing the job resulting in a lesser skilled Ban team. And, opponent's luck is an alibi to camouflage our pathetic temperament and poor presence of mind and focus, which are among the most important aspects of sport. Skills alone not enough; Shunn these shortcomings and be a force to recon. Plz pub.

Hello guys, I do not want to take any credit away from India. I have congerculate them from the botton of my heart for wining such a close match. However, i have looked into the scorecard of IND vs BAN (http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc-world-twenty20-2016/engine/match/951353.html) and i have found this from my analysis. Please correct me what i am doing wrong. BD total runs should be 146. Please look the calculation below:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bowling runs calculation : Nehra 29 + Bumrah 32 + Ashwin 20 + Jadeja 22 + Pandya 29 + Raina 9 = Total 141  + Extras 5 = Total 146  (should be)

Shabbir was not out. Even though it was clear that he was in the air(both his legs) when dhoni took off the bails, his position on ground is supposed to be the last point of contact of his body or gear with the ground. And his last point of contact was inside the crease where he jumped of his back leg. This theory of last point of contact with the ground is used in many games like Basketball, handball, soccer and even cricket(where many player complete a catch by tossing the ball in air before going out of boundary and coming back inside the boundary touching the ground and catching the ball). 
</p>
<p>
Consider a situation when a batsman is running/standing well inside the crease and he jumps in the air and someone take off the bails. That ofc is NOTOUT. 
</p>
<p>
Of all the cases where player is given out because of his bat or leg being in the air is because some part of his body is touching the ground outside the crease so he is deemed to be outside the crease.

Well played Bangladesh and India. It was an exciting match, anything was possible in that match including a super over so as fans we should thank both teams for such an exciting game of cricket. 
</p>
<p>
India won only due to "Divine Intervention" , looking back cannot find any reason why they won, agreed, Dhoni was fantastic but still it was Bangladesh's match to lose. India's batsmen need to step up, Aus vs Pak match, Aus were 60 for 3 and Steve Smith, Maxwell, and Watson accelerated the innings from the difficult position to 190+. Unfortunately, we have only Kohli who seems to be consistent. Last chance India, please do well. All the very best. Let the "Divine Intervention" continue... I still feel Harbajan will be difficult to handle for Aussies, they will probably handle Hardik easily, even though I love Hardik's lower order hitting.

well played team India. The next match is very important against Australia. As of now Top order except kohli has not shown good form. Dhawan and Rohit seem quite ordinary batsmen in three matches. So in the next match Rahane can be good replacement of Dhawan as Rahane is much better fielder than Dhawan. In middle order I think Yuvi should bat at no. 4 so that he can get more time in middle and Raina &amp; Pandya must be kept for situation when asking rate is high or to accelerate the run rate. Dhoni should keep himself as finishing role. Now come to bowling Team India should play one more spinner in place of pandaya according to pitch condition as It will give team more option if one spinner had a bad day. Summary is Rahane must be included in next match in place of Dhawan n one spinner can be added in playing XI in place of Pandaya If pitch condition allows.

This was what T20 is meant for. Nail biting finishes. And in last over it can happen. There are numerous examples from IPL. So, a match is not finished until it is finished. If BD had done it in an ODI, I would have called it that BD lost it. But, since it is a T20, I would say that India and in particular M S Dhoni won it. Why are people getting surprised here? That is a ROUTINE T20 STUFF. Great match though. It can never say whether BD is up there and improved, or India has declined. Its about handling the pressure, and play to the situation with quick thinking. India did that. Plain and simple. BD still need to do more to prove themselves.

@NISLAM4: So you admit India is a Juggernaut. The chariot of Lord Juggernaut
may be toppled by a "tiny stone" on the path. That is always a possibility. But the probability of happening so is very very small. Because the chariot is too big compared to the "tiny stone".

@LAN0089: As an Indian fan you should not have such a weak heart. Self belief is a very important thing. Remember you are an Indian. Indian team does not believe in weak heart, luck, miracle etc., etc. Of course in T20 anything is possible; like BD losing by one run. What was the probability? answer is zero. But India turned that zero to one hundred at the end. How did the do that? They did that because they knew that how to do that. That was the reason. It was no luck and no miracle. Himmat Rakho.

BD should think about next game , they should prepare for NZ clash forget about this performance and prepare for Eden pitch , same tactics , want to see more home work and  like to see Nasir instead of Holm.  give more chance to your proven smart and brave player.  and remember plan more  for last 4 over.  al amin is  not a depth bowler , no one member that al amin cost 17 runs at the 18 over , that cost BD this match , India should not score more that 140 in this match.  if BD can apply similar strategy i think  Nz will find it tough and i am sure that they can not read Mustafiz at all.

Who cares if you lost in last 3 balls, or in last 3 overs... you lost, and you have been losing since time immemorial with 1 or 2 here there wins in your (mostly) home ground! big deal!.... 
remember you have 3-0 in the present series as well, empty vessels are just too loud!

MESSAGE TO DHAWAN... Dont listen to experts, they will confuse you. (Remember, Irfan Pathan?). Is it that you have never hit a six or four? Trust Your hitting prowess, either HIT OUT or GET OUT. Yes there is a risk but as is the saying-'No Risk, No Gain'. 
Look Sir Dhawan, for all last few matches, u didnt took risk and that is why you couldnt score much. Being an opener, Your job is to attack, not to held innings together. Have you heard the noise when we open the cap of Thumsup? Make your presence felt. All The Best.

I guess team india doesn't have to prove their dominance in t20 cricket simply because right from the tour of Australia where india humiliated Australia by 3_0 margin in their own backyard,then 2_1 against srilanka,later winning the asia cup where team india won all the 5 matches and the title and once again here in india they already have won two out three played so far.so the record says that out of 14 t20 matches played team india has won 12 matches.i guess that's not a bad record.

Anybody who criticises India because they won by just one run is ILLOGICAL. I have seen teams reaching finals because of Rains and other uncontrollable things. India certainly have done more than those teams  in this IndiaVSBang match. Didnt they?  ;)

What a performance by Indian Team. This proves India can win matches even if only half its batting strength is firing. Last ball setup was a master stroke from our dependable Captain and Mr. Cool. How many captains in the world can think like that. The pulled off a win just by outwitting the opponents. 
I don't care if the win is by 1 run or 100 runs. All that matters is 2 points which no amount of positive run rate can beat :) 
This looks like a world cup winning team to me.
Cheers!

Need to win matches else in next world cup BD will have to qualify once again to play with big team.

Which team is better?
Both played good cricket against big teams and lost.

After reading many articles and hundreds of comments, it is obvious that BD team have definitely won the hearts of the neutral cricket fans! Lots of neutral fans were rooting for BD, based on cricinfo gametime comments and were disappointed at their loss at the end. In many ways it in indeed a win. Winning the heart of fans is always a win.

Bangladesh are punching above their weight like Sri Lanka used to be, and congratulations for that and they have a good future ahead.But some one needs to drill it into their heads that at the end of the day its about winning the match( even with risk free singles), rather than hitting the ball in the air( going for the glory shot as Gavaskar kept saying).In other words their batsmen lack the maturity and calmness under pressure to see the big picture.Are they the New Chokers in international cricket?Dhoni is the best example of calmness under pressure.Maybe they should hire him as a mentor ones he retires.

@JASON FOX: I am sorry, I could not appreciate your foxing. India did not escape. BD do not have a jaw that can chew and help BD swallow India. India showed with full professionalism how to handle a cricket match. India showed that things were under their control up to the end. Yes BD tried their best and the way they played was admirable. In nature everything has a reason. The word "miracle" belongs to weak and blind believers.  It is used by superstitious people who are unable to accept reality with reason.

I'm an Indian, will admit that Bangladesh improved a lot and seem to bring best performance against India, well they should try to do that against every country. I would say they're in top 6 (and not num 10). Fans, be patient.
India, your performance needs to improve in order to stay in contention. It was your fault (dropped catches etc) that the match had been this close in the first place. All the best :)

India should step up their batting performance, otherwise no way to beat stronger teams. from here we will play much stronger teams only.  reading pitch wrongly, not respecting the pitch behavior, fail to predict bangladesh(and newzealand) plan and tactics at-least in the middle of our innings shows there is no experienced coach with indian team but with opposite team. Well played Bangladesh.

All epic matches have a touch of luck and some blunder. Mushfiq's over enthusiasm cost Bdesh the match. But he made 2 boundaries before that. So, nobody to blame. Now, Bangla need to relax and then fully focus on NZ match. We need to better our 7-1 record against NZ in last 4 years.

India would have qualified even with a tie with Bangladesh (I think there is no super over for group matches) if they beat Australia. Then Aus/Pak would not qualify as they would be on 4 points max. Simple equation for India is to win the next match (in fact, next 3 matches to win T20 WC).

The truth is no team takes BD lightly anymore --the way they've been performing lately. i wont be a surprise if they beat NZ.
Every ind-bd match in recent times has been sort of a thriller --even though all the media in the world stereotype India as almost-guarenteed winners! None of the wins came easy. Havent ind-bd matches become more interesting than india playing any other asian team today? I hope we see more of Mahmudullah, Taskin &amp; Mushfiqur in IPLs too. Good Luck BD against NZ!

I have never seen any wicket keeper in my life since my first game of 1983 World Cup (India WI Final) keeping with one glove, you do not he smarter than this. He didn't worry about a catch but he trusted his bowler to bowl a unhittable delivery so that he can run and get the batsman out.

The most surprising thing about BD squad is that they have selected too many inexperience players and i think it is their one of the prime cause to loss matches

@KANGROOS.PROTEAS.MONKEYS.LIONS: BD proved nothing. How can they prove anything when they cannot even score 2 runs in 3 balls and at the same time they lost three wickets in most ridiculous and irresponsible way. There are a number of teams in the world who do not play cricket to win a cricket match but to defeat India and India only. This is a club of teams. Even when one of them or any other team beats India all others cool off. I do not have to explain this to you why they behave like that.

Coming from an SL fan : Dhoni's calmness is incomparable even to any of the calmest of captains this game has seen, like, steve waugh, richards, Hansie cronje, Ranatunga etc. Only insecured persons will shout out of minds during victories as they think they dont deserve it. Even after winning as many world cups. this guy is all calmness. You can get another Sachin/Akram/Lara/warne but can never get another Dhoni in cricket The way he said 'Out' after that last ball without too much emotion or spice shows what this man is upto. Fans of other countries (including my fella SL fans) should just admire and enjoy such games, learn the life lesson of composure of players like Dhoni, instead of claiming 'luck' etc.

@RAJNISH_AGGARWA u r right. Even though i admire dhonis captaincy skill, he has been the favoritism king from start. He could not stand players like sreesanth, but would give chance after chance to cancer sympathy Yuvaraj, Flat track king Rohit, Once in a life performers Dhawan and Raina. Kohli is the only consistant performer.  Get Kohli out early and any team can win aganist India just like we dependedheavily on sachin back in the 90s. Wish everyone else too would show the passion and class of Kohli..

We have to analyze our mistakes and then play accordingly other wise it is very difficult to beat Aussies,our batting has not pass any substantial score in any match, it is really annoying.Batsman have to feel their responsibility.

He mentored every bowler and also guided Dhoni all the way through and that is why Dhoni respects him so much. Its either India or Australia who will win this world cup from her.

No matter what anyone says, for me, so far in the tournament, the best catch has been the one that S Sarkar took of H Pandya. Absolutely stunning stuff. I think S Sarkar will be in the top 5 catches twice.

Win is a win, whether you win by an inch or a mile. Only thing people remember in the future is that IND won just like we remember 2007 that BD won, most of us do not even remember much of that game. There are only few things that we remember. Life is too short. The big difference between the current BD team and the past is that NO TEAM takes them lightly anymore.

Bangladesh was lucky enough to brought the game upto this level. If those four catches were held bangala wouldnt have crossed more than 100 runs. Dhoni is one of the unlucky captain lost 69% of his toss still managed to win games with his sharp cricket mind and grt presence of mind. Since he won many close encounters than anyother captains he unfortunately termed as luckiest captain.

Hope it is not late to post my comments. The war of words between two fan clubs is more interesting than watching the game. Only thing which comes to my mind is that the team which loses three wickets in the last three balls needing just 2 runs is not a good team at all whatever being the country. All of my learned friends in this forum are aware this beautiful game is not just played with ball,  and bat or size alone but with wisdom and cricketing sense which BD obviously lacked. Set this right first and go for glory later.  Until then no point in searching for excuses or finding fault with others. Thank God! No luck elements found in this match except a few luck-oriented critics. One thing is for sure that BD found a place in cricket history some how or the other but definitely not a good place. None other than BD team would perform Harakiri like this. I also wish to know why so much of hatred and menace expressed by the BD fans against the Indian Team? Please enlighten this issue.

BD has lost this nail biter game. Lucky escape for India, but a win is win. We accept the truth and move on. And yes, congratulation to Indian Team. An avid Indian fan. Except few BD fans (if they are really BD fans), most of BD fans are polite and we give respect to opposite teams when it is due. However, I don't see many Indian fans are polite either. It's a gentlemen game. We should respect each other. Please don't spread hate. Just  Enjoy the Cricket.

BAN v IND is one game in the tournament. Even the destruction of IND by NZL didn't garner so much attention. It's amazing that Bangladesh a rickety can rattle the very foundations of the "establishment" by daring to win. Onwards and upwards. I agree my Asian brothers let not spread hate. Let's just enjoy that much time and again it a thrilling encounter, where batsmen, bowlers as captains all applied their collective strategies. Let's just say... Cricket won and ai am proud to say Bangladesh was part of the greatest T20 in history!

A legendary football coach Bobby Bowden once said " moral victory is like a 6 feet man drowning in a 3 feet pool.. He's still dead!". Bangladesh cricket team lost their game, and their fans are clinging on to the moral victory. At the end of the day, their team lost. Accept the truth and move on. And yes, agreed, their team is much improved and inexperienced, and have huge potential. Focus on the potentialinstead of whining about the "almost won". An avid Indian fan.

Well played Bangladesh. They executed their plans well during bowling but didn't plan while chasing. It could have been an easy chase had they planned well. Rahim and Mahamudullah gifted their wickets. Immature batting by both of them. Anyway, they are improving in each match and will be a tough team to beat in the near future. India didn't bat well as Rohit and Raina gifted their wickets. Rohit's wicket was unnecessary as India had scored already 15 runs in that over. And raina was trying to hit each and every ball which didn't make any sense. Anyway, they played as a team and they were charged up while fielding. Good captaincy by MSD as he rotated his bowlers well and dragged the match till last over. And the last ball was an intelligent work by MSD. Only he can think something like that (run out). And credit to Pandya as well as he bowled on the off side so that batsman could not reach. Good Luck to India for the match against Australia.

Delaying tactics in the last over increased the eagerness of Mushfiq and Mahmood. They were in good touch and delay disturbed their concentration and when they got the first ball tried to hit for a six to do a Miandad. Dhoni confessed during the post match that he used the time left which is a negative tactics. Umpires should have intervened here. Anyway, BD proved that India are no more favorites to win the T20 world cup.

I must admit Bangladesh fans are enjoying fruits of hard work of theirown great players like the Pilot aka Khaled Mashud...Sujon aka Khaled Mahmud...Sumon aka Habibul Basher.Mohammed Rafique...Mohammed Ashraful etc. They always kept you guys in loop in this dominating game of riches and poor. It's time for you to pay them back with more wins and appreciation from opponents. I came across this context by father of U19 cricketer Sarfaraz Khan "On start of any cricketing career,  there will two bags. One bag full of luck and one full bag empty of  experience. As days pass by the bag of luck runs out that is where you have to look to fill the bag of experience".I only wish Bangladesh don't fade out like other ONCE A CHALLENGING TEAM...Remember heroics of Zimbabwe, Kenya? And you see where they are now.It's time for Bangladesh fans to step up and respect opposite teams and step up to gentlemen game. Learn from rise of Sri Lanka. Please don't spread hate. Spread Love. Enjoy the Game :)

Sadly, this is not the first time, BD has lost many nail biter games in the past. But it is different time now, BD has the best coaching staffs, best pace bowlers, and a balanced batting lineup. Still they can not win. Expectation is not to just beat India but all the teams who are on their way. Unfortunately, BD is yet to win a single game in the world cup. BD doesn't have winning attitude that they can beat anyone anywhere in any condition. I think it is time for all BD players to set the bar high. With current pole of talent and coaching staff BD must need to achieve better result. Winning a tournament will be the first goal. Only way team can achieve that if players have winning attitude and believe that they can beat any opponents in any condition.

it was definitely Bangladesh fame to loose... they got few lucky chances initially due to drop catches and fielding lapses but they might have finished with singles.. ultimately it was dhoni who inspired them to go for glory shots and pay the price.. it should be wake up call for india to be title contenders they need to be more aggressive

BCB should let go all the BD selectors. Four players Mithun, Saqalin, Imrul, and Hom should never be part of the T20 team. Since BD plays BPL, they must have better T20 talent. But selectors are keep bringing the same old players. I think it is time BCB should make a change.

One thing I would like everyone to pay attention to is- if India beat Australia, they face number 1 team in the other group, which is West Indies right now. As Indians, we should hope that is not the case, that somehow South Africa beat West Indies to the top, and play against us.

Ind captain Dhoni is a shrud captain; nevertheless, you need luck too, what if any of those two blasts by set batsmen had gone the distance... that's luck or unluck for BD. Bangladesh, Now lessons learnt: Winning is more important than winning in style by hitting a six or a four. Move on.

@banglabandhu: if a team hv test status since 16 years and still don't hv won any tournaments that's mean u hvnt played good enough  to a test playing nation standard..u should concern more about that instead talking about upset at this level..as early u people understand that,u will be more happy and ur team will progress in right direction..
Just wondering for one odd win in ICC tournament and cheering for that and think job done well is not to deserves to test playing nation..u gotta upgrade ur game so we can hv more competitors in ICC tournament... we need BD,afghan in Asia to grow cricket in Asia and later worldwide...

Once in a while, every top cricketing team performs badly against a low ranked team. Just look at every WC tournament. Ireland beat England. BD beat India etc. It happens. If BD wants to earn the seat in top cricketing nations, they need to perform consistently. And Consistency is the main problem. Every now and then BD sparkles with superlative performance against top countries. However, more often than not BD fails miserably and predictably. Pakistan has been poor recently and hence the India vs Pak matches do not bring the same passion anymore. If BD steps up and replaces Pak, many Indian fans would love to have Ind vs BD rivalry. Hats Off to the BD fans who are very passionate about their team.

@CRICCRITIC3: When Indian players will retire that is a part of Indian culture. And Indian cricket culture is not determine by other nations; not even by the ICC. At the end of the day what matters is whether we are successful or not and maintain our ICC ranks in all formats of cricket morally and legally without breaking any rules without bending our wrists more than 15 degrees. Our players are national players. They do not have to follow the path and culture of international players. We play international matches and try to win. In fact, some parts of our culture are like international treasure, like Mr. Dhoni's cool head. Just see how tomorrow BD will try to follow him in order to avoid another single run disaster.

@banglabandhu:it was celebration of letting BD fans smell candy for multiple time but finally ind snatch it back... trust me u shouldn't be this much disappointed if BD was folded in 130.. ind didn't lost any wickets till 5.5 overs that made mashrafe to try every bowlers..and he had that courtesy cause ball was gripping, stopping,spping so fast/spin both had help in first inning..while BD batted bowl stopped gripping,stopping and so our fast bowler didn't hv that Courtney... so batting got easy in second inning(ACCORDING TO UR CAPTAIN).. we really applaud ur fielding effort, that catch from sarkar was turning point..if our fielder would hv catch atleat one of those catch,BD could hv not reach this much close..again We don't believe in ifs, but, so our fielding was not upto standard and we paid prize for it, almost lost the game..but even if a team perform too much poor in field and still win, they deserves to celebrate.. Continues.....

I had asked before the match with Pakistan, Do we deserve to win the World Cup with such selection. Every other team can boast of one right arm leg-spinner, who are the most difficult bowlers to score against, but India has kept them out and instead invested in Harbhajan Singh and Pawan Negi, who will not play at all because we have better bowlers in Ashwin and Jadeja. Similarly Dhawan, Yuvraj, Raina are well past their prime. India does not have any innovative batsman who has the guts to play reverse sweep or scoop past legslip in difficult situations. They are not even able to bat for 20 overs and Kohli has to play as Rahul Dravid of T20 ( all grounded shots).  How the character of batting strips become dangerous when Indian Team is batting and loses its bite the moment other team bats, must surprise the Jug heads selectors. Kohli, Dhoni, Ashwin, Jadeja, Bhumra and Nehra are the deserving players in the team. Rohit, Pandya and Raina are half performing ,Yuvi &amp; Dhawan NPAs.

one of the Best Games in the History of T20 Cricket, Bangladesh has proved they have come a long way in Limited Overs Cricket in the last 2 years and it is evident with their recent results. Dhoni and Musharafe showed great captaincy skills in this Match. Hard luck BD fans, Cheers to indian fans.

If India wins this WC (way uncertain at the moment, just imagine), Dhoni will be the captain with highest number of WC titles. He still is tied up with Ricky Ponting. This speaks his greatness.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>
But I still want Dhoni to step down as a captain at least a year before his retirement. He'll be great help to Kohli. Even though Kohli is great player and successful captain (U19), he still need to learn from Dhoni a lot.

Anyway guys calm down, IND v BAN was a nail biter and I will feel proud when all the re runs keep being shown on the cricket sports channels about how mighty IND beat the odds to overcome gutsy and fearless BAN in a game for the ages. By promoting Indian "legendary status" the media will inadvertently promote the insurgence of BAN cricket. This hard fact maybe too much for some IND fans to bear. As I mentioned before .... We have arrived!

this is the difference between, Indian players and international players. International players retire while they are still producing runs and are in awesome form.

and compare it with Yuvraj Singh, man, this guy is one awful performer and still does not want to leave and occupy seat in India team (not sure who is helping him to stay)!

We often hear of a team converting a certain defeat into victory by some 'out of the skin performances'. Yesterday, Bangladesh did the opposite - convert a certain victory into miserable defeat by a 3-ball madness.

BD fans can claim that their team has truly arrived when it actually BEATS someone. In the WC, BD has lost 3 out of 3 games. The defeat against Pakistan was a huge one. And the same Pakistan team was soundly beaten by India. Agreed, that BD pushed India to the edge yesterday and were on course to winning but that wasn't only because good cricket by BD. It was largely due to bad cricket by India. Indian openers were slow, the middle order didn't click and the lower order didn't fire as much as it was needed. On top of that, India dropped 4 catches. If after all of these things, your team still cannot close out the game and win, then it hasn't arrived yet. It is definitely better than the BD team a few years ago; better than Zimbabwe and Kenya but NOT as good as Australia, NZ, India and SA. Still a long way to go.

Wondering how a thrilling last ball loss wins millions of Indian heart, but a win here could easily spark million BD haters! BD team was targeting to gain respect from big opponents , the moment their two best bowlers were suspended amidst of a tournament. Hope Tigers will come back even harder against NZ to accomplish their final mission. Thanks both the team for the best thriller in the history of T20!!

@BANGLABANDHU, The match was close due to India's mistakes rather than Bangladesh reaching their level. Sabbir's boundaries of pandya, tamim swinging his bat at every ball and mashrafe swinging his bat at everything show that bangla tigers have a long way to go. The dropped catches were responsible for the close match. Had Ashwin and Bumrah taken those catches the match would have ended quickly. It was an off day for Indian fielders. But the Bangla youngsters like Mustafizur, Taskin and Sabbir along with Mahmudullah are showing great promise and if they continue to develop at this rate they will be more than a match for the other teams in the next world cup. And it was dhoni's captaincy which ultimately won the match for India.

this seems like a record of total number of comments made. A total of 1040. WOW, I have never seen that many comments on an article. For BD fans, you lost a game that was in your bag. The game was yours to lose and you lost it. A great game by an much improved BD, even Sanjay Manjrekar said that. Only thing BD team and there fans needs to improve on is to have patience and confidence. BD was over confident and no patience. Mushfiqur celebrating after hitting the boundary was very childish, reaction of fans in the game crying like a baby amazing. There was a lot of talk between Indian players in the last over, but BD players were standing alone and just watching there was no discussion between batsmen as to counter the pressure, mushfiqur, mahmadullah were overconfident that they can do it and didn't bother to talk as to what to do. BD is good team but the reactions of team and fans were priceless.

SALT.BITE ON  MARCH 24, 2016, 14:04 GMT: I think once again my point is being proven by ththe se types of demeaning comments. The No 1 ranked team should not have been in such a nail biter with the no 10th ranked team. Read though the comments of how BAN is being tarnished a minnow, as a team who has learnt nothing as a team who has no right to be in this tournament etc etc and compare those comments with the crowd and IND team reaction. BAN did lose and it had nothing to do with IND pressure. Pandya WWW headline is deceiving and we all know it. Despite all the hurdles put in our way BAN has smashed down the door of the ODI "in" club and is now pushing people around to squeeze onto the "exclusive" T20 table. As Masharafe said Bangladesh cricket does not stop here. Just like it never stopped at that other Asian Cup final in 2012 versus PAK. Believe me, Pakistan knows what happened after that.

If Dhoni doesn't trust Yuvraj Singh then no point playing such an old horse. Rahane is good to replace Yuvraj. Both Rohit and Dhawan are out of form. Dhoni need to replace one of them with player from 14. I would go with Harbhajan over Bumrah. Pandya has to bowl as 2nd seamer. Without these change India will remain mediocre in this T20 WC.

Bad luck for Bangladesh,  hopefully they will learn to keep calm in the future. A shame they lost but still another good showing against a top opponent.  NZ and the Windies looking like the two top teams, India overrated. This new batch are not great players of spin like Dravid, Tendulkar and co were.

Let us not forget that Bangladesh has lost three of its games. And has a (high) chance of losing the fourth against the Kiwis. And this is seen as a good performance? Wow - it seems expectations set for a B'desh performance are still rather low, all the talk of improvement notwithstanding.

The reaction to the win by IND and the fans was the reaction of an underdog beating a giant in cricket. The way the game played was as if two equals were butting head. Nobody is talking about how Mashrafe used 5 different bowlers in the first 5 overs to flummox the "best batting lineup in the world". Nobody is talking too much about the vast difference in fielding between BAN in the AUS match and this match. Nor about the batting by a committed BAN side. Or the weak bowling from IND. It's all about the 3 last balls but I am sure AUS have noticed all that I have mentioned! Well done on your win... let's visit this space once the final qualification has been made.  Then we can compare BAN and IND as two teams who failed to qualify to semi finals.

@SALT.BITE exactly bro but need to choose between from Yuvi,Pandya,Dhawan,Rahane,Manish Pandey,Bhajji,Amit Mishra. If India plays like this then India cannot win. Need players who suit conditions and requirements.All are utility players but which one is best suited is the question.

Genie to Mushfiq- You can ask me for three wishes. Mushfiq- 1)I want india to score something they have never defended.2) I want India to drop catches,more than they have in a single T20 game.3) Either me Or Mahmudullah bring BD home . Guess what they are responsible for BD leaving for home early.

Last ball, what if batsman had nicked and keeper had dropped it as he was not wearing keeping gloves? Winner takes all. Match was between no. 1 and no. 10 ranked teams, but still no. 10 team dominated most part of the match. India dropped 2 easy catches still they won. Dhoni scored 4 off last 3 balls he played. What kind of finisher is he who can not hit 4s and 6s in last 3 balls. This team is ranked too high in ranking. An Indian fan who can followed cricket since 1985.

BD fans still claiming that their team has arrived...a big joke that is. Please look at the points table first, BD is dead last and knocked out of the tournament as always. Even NTH almost beat them in qualifiers when they lost only by 8 runs. IND has a record of 3-0 vs BD this year and not to mention a supremely one sided over all record across all formats and so does every test playing nation. Winning a couple of series at home against depleted sides dosent indicate that a team has arrived.

I am an Indian cricket fan. I wish to congratulate Bangladesh team for their sterling performance. I can understand the heart breaking feeling that their fans and countrymen are feeling right now. I sympathize with them. All is not lost for BD cricket as I am confident that their team will continue to improve. My gut feeling is that BD cricket had just turned the corner yesterday. They have proven that they are no more paper tigers. I sincerely hope that India and other countries invite them over to tour their countries from now on a regular basis. International Cricket deserves Bangladesh now more than ever before!

If you look at the results, Ireland is a better T20 team than Bangladesh.  Ireland won 24 of the 53 T20s (45%) whereas BD has won 20 of 61 T20s (33%). Against Test nations, Ireland has won 2 of 15 matches (13%) where as BD has won 5 of 37 matches (14%).

@banglabandhu: after giving four chance u tells it lucky escape... its other way actually BD got unlucky they couldn't cross the line after getting that many chance which is unusual from this indian side... after celebration of indian fans and hand smacking on head by bd fans they knew that BD is now out of tournament..sorry but its true BD hv no chance anymore and again wait for couple of years to prove your worth... this is WT20,u don't get as many chance as u got luckily but again if u can't capitalize it,u don't deserve to be lucky

People who are sating that this game proves that BANG are better than Pak are hypocrites. The logic that they are using is "if x team (BD) performs against z team (India) better than y team (Pak) performed against z team (india), then x team (BD) is better than y team (Pak)" This may be correct in Mathematics (If x+2=z and y+4=z, x&gt;y), but in cricket, it is very flawed. Simply change x team to be Pak, y team to be India, and z team to be BD. If these people are consistent with their logic, then they admit that Pak is better than India, as Pak beat BD better than India beat BD.

Teams like B'desh or Afghanistan with bottom rankings are capable of pulling a stunner as I believe they have the advantage of being taken lightly by the regular members and as such they do not have much to lose. Nevertheless, well played Tigers. Regular and consistent performances will surely help you to match the bigger league soon....

In WC'2007, on March 17, 2007, Bangladesh defeated India to make them difficult to reach next round. Mushfiqur Rahim played a pivotal role in that match. Yesterday, on March 23, 2016 same Mushfiqur Rahim got emotional and threw away the match and got BD eliminated from the WT20C 2016.

Slowly but surely gaining stature in the shorter formats. The ODI series wins they had against, PAK, IND and SAF plus their performance in the 2015 ODI WC garnered a lot of respect coming into this T20 WC. It wasn't as before where BAN was being talked down to. Yesterday was a nail biter but don't forget BAN v AUS was also very tense. The IND team, know they had a lucky escape, they know they were out bowled, they know how they were slowly letting down their countrymen. We all saw the pictures we all heard the silence. This wasn't PAK, WI, SAF, AUS or SL doing this it was 10th ranked BAN! Although BAN was disappointed. the celebration by IND and her fans is an acknowledgment that we have arrived.

I am proud of our team ,they played very well(more than my expectation). Hope they will play well in next match against NZ. Congrats India for their win-they deserve it  because they hold their pressure till the end of the game and all we know that its t20 and one ball is enough for changing the result of the game.

@TOMMYTUCKERSAFFA You are From SA. You are actually frustrated the way Ashwin-Jadeja Duo perished SA in Test series with ball and bat. You don't Poke your nose into India's Cricket. First get rid of Chokers tag. Both Ashwin And Jadeja are match winner. Hardik PANDYA is also a utility cricketer. The point is to pick between Hardik ,Shami or other as per situation. Don't play 'Divide and enjoy'. India is better cricketing nation than yours SA. First taste the victory of WC then advice ..

Guess what I switched of my laptop when BD needed just 2runs of 3balls because I thought India were done and dusted.Infact 999 times out of 1000 BD could have won that match.Even as an Indian fan it's just outrageous of BD to lose from that situation,there is no excuse to lose that match.India despite winning the match are still not good enough for the WC title,the batting depends too much on Kohli.Lastly,thanks BD for such good match,last one year BD has improved a lot and their win against big team should no longer be called as an upset anymore,Infact BD probably is the second best Asian team right now in limited over cricket.Best of luck for next match.

Bangladesh is a good team, they should be given automatic qualification in icc tournaments but are still not good enough to compete against the likes of Aus, SA , Ind and NZ. Most of sabbir's runs yesterday were through edges. Shakib was the only one in control of the bowlers except the ball where he was dropped by ashwin. Tamim was living dangerously and Mushfiqur's boundaries were due to luck. The scoop he tried was actually an edge for four and Indian fielders were not at their best . Sarkar was lucky not to face ashwin before. They were trying too hard to win and that was their undoing. And Pandya's last 3 balls were ordinary deliveries. They would have won comfortably had they taken singles. Instead , they tried to emulate dhoni and went for big shots and threw away their wickets. For a change it was not kohli who made the difference between the two teams. And Dhoni's stumping was a masterclass. If we are to win against Australia rohit and dhawan have to put some runs on the board

I think since there is no overrate in the last over, and the fielding side can discuss strategies among each other, the batting side should also be given the same option where they get a chance to discuss strategies with either captain or some other player who isn't batting at the time.

@TOMMYTUCKERSAFFA i agree with you, this @Saurav Jain guy is trying to make a career out of criticising Pandya who keeps on performing with both bat &amp; ball. He is probably very upset that his favourite player Jadeja has no batting technique whatsoever &amp; just relies on some luck based blind hitting like Javagal Srinath used to be for India. Ashwin, Pandya &amp; Negi are all better batsman than Jadeja period.

Congrats to India for not loosing the match and Congrats to BD for putting up a game which brought the crowd to edge of the seat.Rather than Bangladeshi fans  it would be Dhoni bashers who will be disappointed. Might be feeling hard to digest the fact that Dhoni and team India pulled it off from the jaws of certain defeat. I could see them trying to pull the word luck in to the conversation rather than appreciating how and what made the game turn around. Dhoni might have lost and won hundreds of matches for india...but just let me know if any other captain let it be any cricketing era..pulled up so many victories in one day as well as T20s from the point of 100% loss just by his out of the box instincts,skill,tactics or even by luck factor. Not even the great Imran could do that.We always highlight the mistakes and failures of Dhoni.. But i dont think any captain matched his ice cool attitude and approach in crunch situations.Time and again he has proved it and will continue to prove.

India should invite BD for a bilateral series. I am sure that there will be enough crowd and  it will be more exciting game than IND vs PAK. Unfortunately many indian fans still think BD is minnow and not worthy to play Mighty India in India.

India cant hope to play proven non performers like dhawan and raina and hope to get away in all matches. Yesterdays match was a good example of how close the opposition came to winning if kohli doesnt cover up for the failures of dhawan, raina and to a lesser extent rohit.

I also see BD fan glorifying themselves after this loss which is jus a T20 game. As long as BD do not win test series...no one is going to count as cricketing nation...it took ages for other Asian teams to win at home and they still struggle in Eng,SA,AUS and NZ conditions.

@HASANKHORASANY : It amuses me - If ICC &amp; other cricketing nations connived to make India win for commercial reasons, I would have thought India would have already qualified for Semi-Finals by scoring 3 facile wins instead of scratchy wins against Pak &amp; BD and a loss to NZ.
</p>
<p>
I can understand your hurt, but be realistic - it was an off day for India on the field as far as their catching was concerned and hence the match went to the wire. On another day, without dropping catches they might have been comfortable winners. Your BD team is improving but don't cast aspersions because you are disappointed.
</p>
<p>
I am an Indian and will say they don't deserve to have the favourites tag they were given before their tournament after such scratchy performances. Having said that, this match could possibly give them the fillip required to raise the bar in terms of their performance, which we only hope.
</p>
<p>
All the Best India - play to your potentional to beat Oz &amp; to BD to keep improving.

About 11 runs were needed off the last over. First ball, they take a single. Now 10 off 5. They hit a four, 6 off 4. Felt like darn, we're knocked out of the WC 2016. A four again and two specialist batsmen on strike. 2 needed off 3. Almost got up to switch off the TV but then I get up and get a feeling that we have MSD and Co. who can still pull this off, even though we had 1% chance of winning it. So I stick to the TV and whoa, a short pitched delivery from Pandya and Mushfiqur gets on the back foot and slogs it over to mid-wicket for Shikhar Dhawan to pull off a lolly pop. A ray of hope emerges. Two off two. A full toss, for a fraction of second it seemed like into the stands but as soon as the camera progresses, we realize it's falling within the boundary and Jadeja grasps it as he always does. Now I'm like, oh god, yer gonna give us a heart attack here. Last ball, MS with his presence of mind keeps off his gloves, grabs the short ball that Hom missed and shatters the stumps!!!

About 11 runs were needed off the last over. First ball, they take a single. Now 10 off 5. They hit a four, 6 off 4. Felt like darn, we're knocked out of the WC 2016. A four again and two specialist batsmen on strike. 2 needed off 3. Almost got up to switch off the TV but then I get up and get a feeling that we have MSD and Co. who can still pull this off, even though we had 1% chance of winning it. So I stick to the TV and whoa, a short pitched delivery from Pandya and Mushfiqur gets on the back foot and slogs it over to mid-wicket for Shikhar Dhawan to pull off a lolly pop. A ray of hope emerges. Two off two. A full toss, for a fraction of second it seemed like into the stands but as soon as the camera progresses, we realize it's falling within the boundary and Jadeja grasps it as he always does. Now I'm like, oh god, yer gonna give us a heart attack here. Last ball, MS with his presence of mind keeps off his gloves, grabs the short ball that Hom missed and shatters the stumps!!!

With due respect to other Teams i think in Asian Block India is the Best Team and Bangladesh supposed to be the Second according to the present form.  In future IND vs BD will be more exciting than IND vs PAK.

@GAURAV CHATTERJEE You are correct. I agree with you. At that point it was too late for (glorious) BD hitters.

Luck is with Bangladesh but they got slipped it. Tamim iqbal dropped catch caused leakage of 20 runs nearly, and few errors etc., last over showed how MS was most experienced leader. He just instructed bowler to bowl at right areas and set fielding proper is enough to say. after first 3 balls itself the pressure is off, but mahmadullah got the misbah's action to take wrong shot, that's the end. Any other team would've dealed different for 3 ball 2 run target.

@SAURAVJAIN - you always keep writing nonsense about Pandya and now Ashwin. Do you have even any cricketing sense. Jadeja is a good bowler and no more a batsman. Pandya will improve with experience. He was hitting the ball hard from word go yesterday and an outstanding catch stopped that innings. I guess ask our SA fans how much they respect Ashwin over Jadeja anyday. Jadeja can't bat. Period.

shocked to see bangladesh fans claiming some sort of moral victory.  your team didn't deserve to win, it should have won.  it didn't because of stupidity/arrogance.  mahmudullah and mushfiqur's celebrations with 3 runs still needed were not just disrespectful but foolish.  they both thought the match was won so went for glory dhoni type shots to finish the game.  problem is neither is dhoni.

This game was similar to the game of 2007 wc india v pak group stage bowl out. last over misbah hit 2 boundaries, here mushfiqur hit 2 boundaries. pak needed 1 off 2, ban needed 2 off 3. sreesanth bowled to misbah, here pandya bowled. last ball run out in both games. only difference was that game was tied, here Ind won by 1 run

This game was not about who played better but this was about who planned their game better. Surely we should applaud dhoni for the win but dhoni's adamant behaviour for not changing the playing XI is worrisome. Even SA left out Dale steyn. I think here it is lack of coach. As team director ravi shastri must be always backing dhoni. But players like dhavan yuvi and even suresh raina are not at all in good shape and unlikeliness of rahane is troublesome.

Did anyone noticed Ashwin denied two runs of the last ball of India's inning?As Ashwin was on the danger end and he may be run out which would decline his batting average! There is no point to deny runs at the last ball of Inning.

The end of the game was the equivalent of a sensational turn of plot in a Hollywood epic Morally tome BD W Were the winners who baked the cake to perfection but faltered when laying the icing .The game was an abject lesson on the importance of finishing touch in a chase.The final boundaries should have been the last nails in the coffin.From touching distance BD  came within a whisker of the target.

We all should appreciate this spectacular match and to my opinion so far the most Thrilling/nail biting match of this ICC T20 2016 world cup India vs Bangladesh !!! India no doubt is by far a stronger and experienced side compare to Bangladesh (BD)  BD, despite losing two of his key bowlers (Taskin and Sunny) in the middle of the tournament which was a major blow for their team's morale but still BD players played like Tigers. hats off to our Tigers. The whole world now should recognize, a strong Cricketing Nation has emerged and its Bangladesh.Best wishes for the Tigers best wishes for other Cricketing Nations and let the game of Cricket prosper.

Those who think the last ball should have been called a wide, look at the replay and educate yourself. The ball was well inside the line, and even after the batsman was not standing straight, the ball didnt bounce over shoulder height. If there is further doubt, see where Dhoni collects the ball.

This whole T20WC India has struggled because of the openers. On slow pitches the key is to score as many as when the ball is new and during the powerplay. But Indian openers have just wasted the balls upfront and did not stick long enough to convert their starts. One of them really need to go from word go and it should be Dhawan.

There should be a some penalty system for slowing down the match. Dhoni and crew took more time than expected to select the field and advise on bowler. Which was definitely taken out the momentum from Bangladesh.

Bangladesh deserved to win this epic encounter and came within inches of a famous win.What lost it was that they just could not lay the final icing on the cake with the game all but won.In the final over the 2 boundaries struck were virtually the final nails in the coffin but lack of temperament lost the day for Bangladesh.The game had  twists and turns  of a famous Holywood thriller with a totally  unexpected climax.I really felt sad for Bangladesh who fought with the resilience and organization of an army batallion coming from touching distance from victory to  a matter of inches from the goal.

@Anil.Sivudu Sir jee there are 12 players in your selected 11. I do like your selection of leaving out Dhawan. I think Rahane deserves at least 10 matches to prove himself. He is a good opening partner for Rohit and Virat coming in after will make our line-up look so destructive. I believe Negi wont be a bad selection however I think the rest of our squad is pretty good already. I really like Pandya Jadeja and Ashwin in the latter order. I am loving Bumrah yorkers. We would possibly need a replacement soon for the Ageing Nehra though right?

A couple of media outlets all seem to be reading from the same source .... this was not a choke. A choke would be where BAN are feeling the pressure. The two fours that Mushi made were proof that they were batting freely and didn't feel pressure. One renkowned analyst, who plays in the IPL, on a UK channel called "Akash", said that if he had the two balls that Mushifiqur and Mahmadullah had been given, he too would have gone for the boundary. Another analyst also said that " we all would be lying if we said we wouldn't try to smash those two balls" Regarding the last ball, Mustafiz had to run 20 yards and Dhoni had to run 15 yards. I don't think that in that race Mustafiz had a chance. BAN brought the crowd to silence several times and tore up the script .... Hopefully that will now be enough for India to invite BAN over for a series in Indian home turf.

So what is the record for most comments on cricinfo? This must be one of the highest ever. Great game between best 2 Asian teams right now no doubt. Please India invite Bangladesh to play more in your country, trust me you will get good crowds, I believe there is now a strong rivalry between these two teams. Stop with politics. Eng, Aus, NZ and SAF should also invite Bangladesh for a change. Can you believe Bangladesh played in India after 18 years? When will ICC start being fair to all the teams? No other sport decreases the number of teams for a world cup, very disappointing to see no associates. Grow the game.

BD could have easily upset India in their own backyard and eventually triggered an early exit for the host WCT20 2016. But the BD's had had other ideas. Some inexplicable madness in the last over robbed them of their glory who contrived to loose under pressure.

Superstar's (Read Dhoni) magical calmness in crunch situations does the trick again. India are back in 2016 WCT20 big time.

To all India haters and doubters. I am surprised that some say "India does not deserve to be in the semifinal or final". WHAT?? After winning the ASIA cup, India were favorites to win the cup. They lost to NZ by 47 runs. Agreed. But BD lost to Pak by 55 runs.  And India comprehensively beat Pak (with 6 wkts and 13 balls). India also beat BD. I agree it was a close match and India did not do too well. But it is just one match. Remember, BD had nothing to lose if they lost and India had everything at stake. The pressure on India was immense. In group 2, India is the BEST Asian team. Full stop!
</p>
<p>
That leaves Australia and India competing for the Semi Final position. Well, Australia also lost to NZ and huffed and puffed to win their match against BD. I would say it is a tough call between India and Aus and hopefully the match on Sunday will decide that. Until then, please rest your doubts on India. Remember, they beat Australia in their backyard 3-0 in T20 recently.

Wow what a finish, but you've got to say Bangladesh threw that away. Both teams certainly had their moments, especially in the field and with the ball, but with 2 needed from 3, the game was for Bangladesh to win, especially with the field still out. Thoroughly enjoyed that chase with the continued swings in momentum, what proper T20 is all about, as well as keeping your nerve. Bangladesh just didn't keep it, whereas the Indian bowlers, fielders and Dhoni did. While Bangladesh, like Afghanistan and in 2014 Holland, are playing good cricket but can't seem to pick up victories. India on the other hand are winning games despite not being at their best, which surely makes them a dangerous proposition. They are still my favourites to win, especially as many of these players know what it takes to win a major tournament.

Thank you VAISHAK13 for answering back and clarifying to JOSHUA_KRAPP. Lot of neutral fans I feel are jealous of India.Hence attributed this Indian victory to luck while Australia ran away with all the accolades for the tied SF against SA in 1999 WC.Both matches were similar and brought heartbreak for the losing side on account of the narrowest of margins.SA was eliminated having lost to Australia in the Super 8 phase of that WC.Gibbs dropping Steve Waugh is another memory of that WC as are India beating Pakistan in Manchester and Pakistan getting thrashed by Gilchrist in the final at Lords.

There are many constructive comments, but more destructive atleast to India. Hope they can eat their own words as BD can pack off after their match with NZ. It does make any difference to the points table as NZ will remain 1 and BD at 5.  Some of the BD fans are so hapless in comments, that their team was about to win WC, cool guys, there are big boys and they wont let you win :) Your place is shown at the points table, at the end of the day, results matter, although performance do. Please come back in 2018 and 2019 WC to show your performance :)
@ Team India - only batting has to come good with a bit of fielding.  pull up your socks, hit a good match and win against OZ. It will be a good match. It is a very simple equation, win and enter semifinals. we just need WWW, and thats 3 wins in next 3 matches, enough to lift the cup. Respect to the BD fans who commented with good stuff.. others should I say anything :)

There are many constructive comments, but more destructive atleast to India. Hope they can eat their own words as BD can pack off after their match with NZ. It does make any difference to the points table as NZ will remain 1 and BD at 5.  Some of the BD fans are so hapless in comments, that their team was about to win WC, cool guys, there are big boys and they wont let you win :) Your place is shown at the points table, at the end of the day, results matter, although performance do. Please come back in 2018 and 2019 WC to show your performance :)
@ Team India - only batting has to come good with a bit of fielding.  pull up your socks, hit a good match and win against OZ. It will be a good match. It is a very simple equation, win and enter semifinals. we just need WWW, and thats 3 wins in next 3 matches, enough to lift the cup. Respect to the BD fans who commented with good stuff.. others should I say anything :)

Do not know when BD boys will learn to manage the pressure. They should learn from Dhoni how to keep your head cool and his never give up quality. I couldn't sleep well last night and still i can't forget the way we lost the game. This is Cricket! Best luck for India. Hope India will go to semi because they have such a COOL captain. BD need to learn many things to be a Big Team. Hope to see another cracking match  NZ vs BD. No matter win or loss, just play your best cricket. Good luck for Tigers.

Totally agree with NABILHOSSAIN. Bangladesh played like tigers. I think they kind of let the easy chase get the better of themselves towards the end. Needing just over run a ball with 5 overs left, they really could have taken lesser risks.

Good God, whoever created Cricket? We had not one but two games of the most excruciatingly exciting variety since T20 was invented. At times I thought my heart might be overwhelmed! Of course the Bangladesh/Indian match was the superior game. The current England batting is a shameful affair, although that doesn't stop heaping praise on the trio of Ali, Willey and Jordan (in that order) and the way they brought their team back from the dead. Even then had flamboyant Shazad done his usual stuff even for 20 minutes England would have remained in the mortuary. Bad luck, Afghanistan, new kids on the block and welcome! Bangladesh had outsmarted India and deserved to win. Their bowling was to plan, as was their batting, until the final over from hell. Four to win, with four balls to go and two of their most senior batsmen at the wicket. But vanity overcame them, trying to finish with too much glory. Last ball's sprint by Dhoni to run out the batsman (rather than throw) saw his team home. Wow!

Luck gave Bangladesh chances like -
1) Pandya to bowl India's weakest bowler.
2) in-form Mahmadullah takes single of 1st ball. Strike to out-of-form Rahim. oh god!
3) out-of-form Rahim hit 2 fours of successive balls. Last time he hit may be 2 years back.
4) Gets bad ball and Rahim gets out, ok but Mahmadullah gets strike (better than new batsman to take strike).
5) Gets full toss and gets out, ok fine but again decent batsman Hom comes on strike.
6) Bangladesh won the toss.
7) India dropped dollies. India never drop catches remember.
Want more luck? Bangladesh. Lets decide on the coin then. Dhoni loses toss 70% time or more.

That was the worst choke of all time. The game was as good as won. Sad to see teams like Bang and Afg self-destruct as they did yesterday. In the end it is all about self-belief. Do we really think we can win? That last over was actually terrible, and all of the last three balls should have been boundaries - too short, dolly full toss, then too short and too much width for the last ball, a simple despatch to the boundary for most international batsman. Yet despite the dishing up of such tripe, Bang managed to gift a wicket on all three deliveries! You couldn't make it up.

At last India just manage to snatch a victory from the jaws of defeat. Ok win is a win. But it is not time for rejoicing, rather time for introspection about players who are consistently inconsistent like Dhawan

Game of the tournament. As a Bangladeshi, I'm disheartened by the loss. But as a cricket fan I would love to see these sort of games every day. My request to the fans from other countries,  please  give credit to Bangladesh team as well. They have gone through a lot in this WT20. Moral was down but still fought till the last.

I would say India has been utterly unlucky to get 3 straight worst pitches to play. Bengaluru pitch had never been so bad or a turner atleast. I hope Mohali will be a belter. That being said, BD played good cricket and Dhoni's brainwork did some trick as well.  Hope all the india haters are having a good time to comment unwanted things. There is no IFs and BUTs in cricket. This is where you need to show talent and not becoming a hero in 1 ball by slogging. Remember an IPL match where 2 runs was needed in last ball, Shane Watson just tapped in front of mid-off and scampered for 2 runs. Now that's called brains. BD has not come this close before and were not able to handle things. India have had more success than bitter taste in last ball deciders, the famous one being Miandad's six for a bitter one and Rajes Chahuhan/Hrishikesh Kanitkar's 6 against pakistan. BD has improved, but not riped yet to compete to the core. Tough luck for them yesterday. India has a good chance to move on......

Whoa! What a match, Nvr seen ryt b4! Combined effort of evrybody , outstanding fielding especially raina rohit jaddu dhavan yuvi n Dhoni..stumping was jst stunning n finnal run out sealed another win. Pandya u beauty! U bowled the deacde of last three balls n u won the match for us, India got ultimately the  bowller like Bumrah who is simply superb in death overs,his last over was the turning points. It created huge pressure to Bangladeshi baters. Good win..nw next is Aus.

Also I see a lot of comments about net run rate and stuff. Please I urge you to look at the points table. For India to go through they need to beat Australia, regardless of other results. It does not matter by how many runs or wickets they just need to win. For Australia to definitely go through they need to beat Pakistan and India. If Australia lose to Pakistan and beat India then net run rate between Australia and Pakistan will come into play, bare in mind in this scenario India will for sure be knocked out. For Pakistan to go through they need to beat Australia and hope Australia beat India but in a tight scenario. New Zealand are definitely through regardless of other results, Bangladesh are definitely out regardless of other results. I know it isnt simple to understand but this is the situation in the group of death!

one of my friend posted in fb yesterday.."Still speechless. Completely heart broken. 4 wickets, 3 balls, 2 runs required, two set batsmen in crease, the weak link bowler of the opponent bowling some full toss deliveries, how can we lose from there? Devastated"..inexplicable....this seemed to have been the ultimate analysis of the game to me..sigh!!

The 23 March jinx broken finally albeit by 1 run. On 23rd March 2003, India had lost WC final v Aus in South Africa &amp; in 2007, on 23rd March,  Sri Lanka had beaten India which led to first round exit. But Dhoni &amp; Team India have broken through the jinx &amp; are looking favorites again. Batting is a concern though. Time for another Jinx( Rahane) to open the batting.

It looks like india don't want to win but this WC loves india so much. 1st india lost to a sure win against NZ then we won this out of no where. But yuvraj should have been a better choice as right handers are playing. We would have win easily if yuvraj bowled, anyway win is a win and we can take that with both hands. Congrats bangladesh, youre no more raising tigers, youre proven tigers.

It was all the way for Bangladesh to win except the first six overs of India innings and the last 3 balls of Bangladesh innings. Dhoni's been an inspiration to everyone, not only in cricket but can be to all who lose their cool for simple things. I was thinking at least it is going to be a super over. But I think he believed India to win right from the beginning and that's the reason we won. And we have to give it to the Bangladesh team for giving a tough fight except for the last 3 balls. Way to go.

BD could have easily upset India in their own backyard and eventually triggered an early exit for the host WCT20 2016. But the BD's had had other ideas. Some inexplicable madness in the last over robbed them of their glory who contrived to loose under pressure.

Superstar's (Read Dhoni) magical calmness in crunch situations does the trick again. India are back in 2016 WCT20 big time.

Everyone should sympathise with Bangldesh cricket team.  At the same time, Indian batsmen will have to blame themselves if India had lost.  Except the openers, other batsmen do not have freedom  to play that many dot balls. Therefore openers, once settle down quickly will have to accelerate and do not put undue pressure on later batsmen to take too many risks.

MSD with his contributions as player &amp; captain has already leap frogged as the best ever captain in all forms of cricket in history of the game. MSD has also been innovative as wicket keeper creating run outs / stumpings with amazing regularity. The run outs of ABD/Miller in CWC 2015, 2 stumpings/ 1 run outs v BD etc. would have been virtually "not out" for other keepers. Ground fielding &amp; catching is not a bonus with MSD as captain. Rarely impact of fielding errors is analysed. IND would secured a comfortable win but for 2 dropped catches going to 2 weaker fielders costing IND 30/40 runs. There were no on field screams from the captain to the concerned fielders with a concern that any such move would have demoralised the players. No wonder then younger of the 2 bowled exceptional 17th &amp; 19th over. Pandya was MOM. IND has the best team in WC 2016 &amp; it is time for batters to manage power play &amp; middle overs effectively. If IND play to potential another world title is not far away.

People asking for Amit Mishra and Manish Pandey, Pls stop. It's becoming irksome to read the comments after every India's match. Check the squad before asking. Amit Mishra and Manish Pandey aren't part of 15. So Please stop. And People asking for Hardik Pandya's head, What do you expect from a guy who has an international exp of 10 matches.? to become a match winner every-time he bats or bowls? Tell me. he scored 15 runs in 6 balls before he was out by a  stunning catch. You expect Harbhajan to score those kind of runs ? I don't think so. He is a very good fielder. much better than Harbhajan. He is just 22 yrs old. he has minimum 10 yrs of cricket left in him. When will he get a chance if not now in such pressure situations ? show some patience before suggesting a sack for the player.

Indian supporter here. When we played NZ I honestly didnt think NZ played that well we just did not bat well. Against Pak I thought they bowled quiet well but were doomed by Kohli. Against Bangladesh I honestly think they were on top of us, they played much better than us, however the fact that we won is astonishing. We did not deserve to win Bangladesh bowled with plans and batted decently till that last two overs. The way India are bowling we deserve to win the tournament, the way India are batting we dont deserve to make it out of the group. Which is so strange to say since we are used to good batting usually.

@SMOOTHRASCAL...Losing or winning, Pandya &amp; Bumrah are very good recent finds for India...Its not easy to keep cool under tough circumstances in international cricket for youngsters who played very few matches (we have seen it yesterday in Khalid Latif's case)...Bumrah's yorkers are bowled with much accuracy...today BD gave tough fight to India than your team...Ind vs BD matches are taking much more importance these days...we got new rivalry on field

Im laughing at these ARM-CHAIR EXPERTS &amp; keyboard coaches who want Pandya to be dropped. They have no sense of cricketing knowledge. Among indian batsman Pandya scored runs at the highest strike rate. He averages 21 with the ball. What more do you want from an all-rounder? Also he is 3 times a better batsman than that fake allrounder R.Jadeja.

Bowling 12 yorkers in a row from Bumrah was awesome as well as Dhoni running out Mustafizur. Both bought calm to the game. But those final three balls were so awful the batsman had to play those shots! Had they been decent deliveries the batsman most likely would have knocked them for singles!!

Two runs needed of three balls for bangladesh . At this istuation it is a customary finish to take singles or two's as Indian fielders were patrolling  the  Boundry line. It is sheer reckless batting of Bangladesh batsman and whatever Bangla bowlers have paved for the victory has gone to dust from Mortaza to Rahman worst batting. Final word our captain cool has masterminded the final over without consulting kholi, yuvraj raina or rohit and taken single responsibility to make the match success . Here dhoni has surpassed tendulkar on captaincy cap even though he is  a legend in cricket . Final word -Indian team should think that is this tense situation is warranted against the weak team. Bangladesh team has gifted this victory to us. INDIAN TEAM SHOULD THINK TO FACE REST OF THE GREAT TEAMS .

I knew few conspiracy theory will show up here after this game. But I am happy people are still commenting here; counting 895 now. Positive comments, negative comments, from IND fans, from BD fans, from neutrals all are good. This shows game was watched by many. Cricket wins in this way.

This match bought out the glorious uncertainties of Cricket. In the last over anything can happen as there is no margin to recover . With this win India will be more confident for Aussie game and they need only a win  and NRR does not matter .

Well then, seeing as Australia are a Shoo-in to win against an out-of-form Pakistan. This virtually makes the India vs Australia match a Quarter Final.

When it comes to bowling pitch and top orders batsman are not able to stroke easily, India must explore Ashwin who is a proper batsman at top order;  He is a good batsman against spin and pace and has all the strokes in the text book. He can contribute with bat and ball and may become a good all rounder also.

Dhoni wasted 12 deliveries (that included two juice full tosses) to produce a princely sum of 13 runs. I think it is time to promote Jadeja and Ashwin ahead of him. Dhoni is not middling anything neither is he timing the ball. All the teams have realized that if they don't full length to dhoni, he becomes an ordinary batsman who can only work the ball for 1 or 2. This is what Rabada exploited in the ODI Dhoni and Kohli lost a couple of months ago and this is what BAN did last night.

@SURYA_THEFIGHTER:If any batsman can in this team can hit 6 from the word go,it's Pandya.And he did that and got out by a freak catch in boundary.Besides his fielding is right up there with Jadeja's standards.I feel either Yuvi or Raina should have bowled the first 2 overs of Pandya.With ball turning,they would have been tough to hit.The only issue I have with this team is absence of Manish Pandey,Shreyas Iyer and Surya Yadav in the 15 squad.Also,openers need to change their slow approach.Not a fan of Dhoni's decisions.But he did 90% of decisions right today.Using Ashwin,Jadeja,Bumrah early kept us in the game.

Indian openers were slow to score in power play due to over cautiousness, which   put all rest batsmen to defensive mode..Atleast one should start hitting early as Tamin did...At last, it's scored runs that counted.Not saved wickets.

This is rather than an Indian victory but a qualifier's mentality just like what happened to Afgans when the England was in the rock bottom at 85 for 7 but still could not pull off a win. When you have not tasted victories regularly in the big league, players become nervous and overcome by impending victory!

Please drop dhawan before he gets another 30 of 25 balls to cement his place for next 10 matches and walk with swagger like viv or Gayle . Kohli can open as he has been for RCB get negi in dhawans place that would have sorted most issues and address the additional spinner as raina and Rohit both can bowl offspin bhajji for pandya is not worthy a gamble mohali is a batting pitch so it's better to have more bowling options than to have batsmen bcoz your top 5 should be good enough with the allrounders I still think on Turner's ashwi. Needs to bat higher

@RH26-thank you for your kind comment. Yes, 10 years back Bangladesh were bottom of the pack Third World country and the change now is absolutely remarkable. In 2030 it is predicted by World Bank to be one of the most modern and the top list of economically powerful country in the world. The cricketing youngsters that are coming through down the line is fantastic to say the least. You are correct in saying improving economy helps.

I think as a captain Mortaza was far superior to Dhoni in this match. Giving single over spells to all bowlers not allowing indians to settle against any bowler's line length in the powerplay and promoting Mithun n himself up the order so  that they has their best batsmen playing the game in the final overs. Both these moves were smart and innovative. 
On the other hand dhoni captaincy was routine to say the least. Scoring 13 off 12 balls is below par. Shabbir stumping was pure luck as he took off the bails as fast as he could neither it was very quick nor intentionally delayed(or do dhoni supporters claim that he intentionally clipped the bails exactly at the instance shabbir jumped) and last ball runout was what you would expect of any international wc. How about the catch he dropped of soumaya sarkar off Bumrah. A lot of international WC ould have taken that.
And about the 2 balls before the last ball, I dont think Dhoni would claim that he had advised Pandya to ball full tosses!

Win for India against Australia in multinational is always happen if Yuvi performed well and become MOM. In WT20 2007 Yuvi scored 70(30) , in 2011 WC he scored 58 Not Out and 2 wickets , in WT20 2014 he scored 60(43) and the list is very long, from his start of his career in U19 WC2000 , Knock out cup 2001 .  In ICC events after 2000 when ever India wins against Aus , Yuvi is the star performer otherwise India defeated except 1-2 match .

This LUCKY WIN by India has got nothing to do with MS Dhoni calmness or any other factors that the Indian fans are crediting their team of. This was pathetic batting by Mahmudullah Riad and Mushfiqur Rahim. The deliveries that both batsmen got out from were just awful which could have been dispatched anywhere in the ground and on the floor. When Bangladesh needed 2 runs from 3 balls then the priority was for the batsmen to score a single and make it safe and then go for the winning shot. But our two batsmen wanted to be heroes and were seeing the big HEADLINES the day after. Funny how the last delivery was never checked for height or from the bowlers point of delivery mark due to being such a crucial moment.

@CAPTAINHANSIE: I understand what you are saying but because of the same pitch we could have got out of the tournament yesterday. Its not in the hands of Dhoni, if it is Dhoni would have surely opted for a batting pitch since we were looking to up the run rate along with a win. The moment Dhawan and Rohit saw the turn from the pitch they immediately tried to go into their shell. Even we fans were wondering why India is playing in such pitches while the other group is enjoying in batting pitches.

I was there at M Chinnaswamy and can't express the feel I got in last over. I was off the field but still it was almost nervous breakdown then you can think how good Ms is in handling pressure. He definitely have nerves of steel. I am a huge MS fan and could not have got a better chance to witness his class behind the stumps and captaincy. Apart from this, it was good to see Nehra encouraging two youngsters in crucial moments of the match. Definitely his experience came handy yesterday. As I said, Dhoni was at his best. His habit to back and instill confidence to it's team mates is just amazing. The way he backed Bumrah after his bad day at field was clearly visible in his last 2 overs. It was exceptional stuff from the young lad. Nehra too was  too good with his death overs. 2 stumpings from MS and that presence of mind in last ball by not throwing the it to stumps but by running and dislodging the stumps was extra ordinary stuff from our skipper. I am damn lucky to witness it all.

Bangladesh worked hard but i find it difficult to understand when people are saying that they deserved to win... they got multiple chances (4 dropped catches), edges gone for four, misfields by Indians.... any team would have come so near like this... So they didnt deserve to win courtsey letups by Indians.. There were two teams who didnt play upto the potential.. and the more matured and experienced team won by fighting, crawling back inch by inch despite being very bad on field...

Congrats to India. This scrappy win cannot hide the weak links in our team. The fragile batting will again be exposed by Aussies unless and until Dhoni changes and brings in Rahane and Harbhajan atleast and fit in somehow. So far India has played on slow pitches and i think we will get only slow pitches from now on where we need atleast three spinners, just look at NZ how they are performing with three spinners. Why can't Dhoni see that.

@JOSHUA_KRAPP.Thats coz Dhoni was well within the ICC rules,and by ICC I mean the 'International' CC.The rules for t20 state that the team bowling shud bowl the FIRST BALL of the LAST OVER within 1 hour and 15 mins.Thereafter the time limit does not apply for the last over.And I guess u check out the rules for height urself,u will know why it wasn't one.

If Pak beat Australia, scenario is simple. 
India lose, they are out, as theyre abysmal NRR will only get worse.
India win, they are through.
Australia win by less than x margin, Pak go through.
Australia win by more than x margin, Australia go through.

@RJH431 I think you have lack of cricketing knowledge. Both the bowlers were already informed about there action.
They were found to send balls with suspect actions after 10 days in Madras , which caused them suspension.
If you don't know, even ojha from inda Silva from Srilanka have faced this situation 
And finally what you want, a bowler who throws the ball , should be allowed to keep on bowling in t20 world cup.
I will tell you that even Amin action is suspected when he ball few of his balls.
He is lucky that on field umpire has not yet noticed. But commenter has noticed. 
Very soon , he will be banned.
Why can't Bdesh bowler can't bowl properly.
If India had any thing to do, they would have gone for Rahman.
Taskin is not a wickets taking bowler. 
You can check his stats in cricinfo

Hardik Pandya was the only batsman who looked comfortable. He was timing the ball sweetly and if not for that extraordinary catch by Sarkar he would have propelled the score above 160 easily. India should use him at one down just to hit the hell out. His wicket wont cost as much at no.3 as it costs at no.5 or 6. Even if pandya fails at 3 there are kohli yuvi raina below him but if he scores then it will be huge benefit. Just use him as NZ uses munro ..btw he is way better than munro in terms of timing and six hitting ability......india have a great talent in him ....look how maxwell developed from a just slogger to a decent batsman without loosing hitting ability..

India should use him at one down just to hit the hell out. His wicket wont cost as much at no.3 as it costs at no.5 or 6. Even if pandya fails at 3 there are kohli yuvi raina below him but if he scores then it will be huge benefit. Just use him as NZ uses munro ..btw he is way better than munro in terms of timing and six hitting ability......india have a great talent in him ....look how maxwell developed from a just slogger to a decent batsman without loosing hitting ability..

Seriously with this kind of performance I doubt India can win this WC... Struggling against Bangla and should over cone Oz hurdle... I can't understand why the hell Dhawan still in playing 11...

When equation was 3 balls=2 runs, the do not need to have boundary. I was surprised why BD tried for boundary? and did not tried for one or twos for 4th and 5th ball.

I am not at all a keen follower of the game. But I wonder, how Ashwin was chosen MOM over Dhoni in yesterday's match against Bangla Desh. Check the figures. Dhoni scored 13 valuable runs, effected 2 stumpings - one of which was outstanding, kept his cool under tremendous pressure, and in last over, effected brilliant run out on the last ball. Also his captaincy was extra ordinary. He guided Pandya very well in the last over. No one deserved MOM award better than him.

On a side note,the way Bangladesh economy is growing in 10 years time and with a good team, which always helps. Bangladesh will become part of Big 4 (India, England, Australia and Bangladesh). Cricket is all about good team on the field and cricket crazy fans and growing economy of the field. Also, If Pakistani economy does not grow as fast Bangladesh's or keep up with it and the Pak team does not perform well, than Pakistan will have to play second fiddle to Bangladesh.--- Predication from an Indian fan.

INDIA is not playing like champions both the matches which they have won were very close encounters and This team India is very lucky team as they say luck favours to those who work hard so there is no doubt about their hard work and dedication but when it comes to talent and skills I will put teams in this order 1. Australia 2. South Africa 3. Newziland 4.India/Pakistan 5.England 6.Bangaladesh /west Indies/Afghanistan.

I don't know why Pandya is being singled out when he performed pretty decently,he was the only batsman who looked comfortable,he smacked 2 fours and a six in no time,he was the reason the run rate went up from below 6.5 to 7.5 and he did get out at the wrong time,but he did not throw his wicket,it was only due to the brilliance of Soumya Sarkar he had to walk back to the pavilion.I don't think any other fielder from Bangladesh would have pulled that catch and that did change the course of the match,if Pandya would have batted 2 more overs he would have sealed the match in the first innings itself.Anybody who is criticizing Pandya here either hasn't watched the match or has poor cricket sense.But what a fielder this Soumya Sarkar is,one against Pakistan and now this one against India,can't make out which one is better.Both the catches were exceptional,he has shown athletic brilliance very rarely seen in players from sub continent.

Two teams played like trying to lose and the better team lost. Much needed thriller for a world cup. There is no luck factor here. India put up a decent total but they let down in the field and Bangladesh returned India's gift in South African style. The last over is a lesson for both bowlers on how not to bowl and batsman on how not to bat. Man of Match should have been for Dhoni for his WK. His 2 stumping and the run out made the difference. High time India look at its batsmen and decide if a players 100 in one match is more worth than consistent scores in many matches. High time Bangladesh and its fan give their opposition the respect that it expects and earn it on the field by being humble as well. Thats why when India lost to NZ it did not feel that bad!

BD threw it away. India were lucky to scrape through. Well played BD, kudos from an Indian supporter. Next time keep your head.
Indian batting is still brittle. There are critical fielding lapses. Hope they tighten it. Curators, more sporting pitches please. No belters, but something for quickies too. How about bit of a grass?

The WCT20 is a platform where  the actual  representation of the quality of International teams are exhibited . Here unfortunately M/s Rohit Sharma , Dhawan and Raina have shown what they are worth . That too on slow low turners not seaming tracks . Its Dhoni's cool and calculated character to instill confidence in th team in times of extreme distress as was yesterday , Virats Class , Yuvi &amp; Nehra by way of summing up all their  vintage abilities , Jadeja, A highly improved Ashwin , the young exuberant brigade of Bumrah &amp; Pandya have seen our boat 'touch the shores' !!! whatever one may say, the first three are IPL heroes - was , are &amp; will remain so ,  Not good enough at all Internationally .

@BEDEKAR.That was not a mistake,that was one of the tactical moves which won us the game. And he himself mentioned why.Small target on board,make sure ur best bowlers leave enough runs for Pandya to defend.What wud have been the point in Pandya bowling the 49th,conceding 12 and leaving Bumrah less than 6 to defend?Small things,but make a big difference,Dhoni as captain.

how long did India take to bowl out the overs? that last over was nearly 20 minutes. SURELY a match ban for captain Dhonii... (that is if ICC is ICC) wasn't that last ball a wide? (for height) this is getting HILARIOUS ..

This loss will hurt Bangladesh for years to come. This is just like SA loss to AUS in 99 WC. These wounds don't heal easily. BAN team let their nation down. That last over was utter stupidity. They could have gone for one run to at least tie the score before going for the glory. Someone else said here and I totally agree - BAN did what only they could do. No other team would have lost the game from that point onward.

@CRICKETFEVER11 India is struggling because of a stubborn captain backing sub-standard players like Raina,Dhawan,Yuvraj,Rohit and Pandya as that gives him the opportunity to hog all the limelight and corner all the credit.With 2 talented batsmen in Rahane and Pandey sitting out,it must be painful for  Indian fans to see India's top order perform the way they are in this WC. Pandey with his match winning century in the Sydney ODI turned India's plummeting fortunes in shorter format cricket on the recent tour of OZ.The Canberra ODI exemplified how the 'Men in Blue' had forgotten to win in colored clothing post SF loss in 2015 WC.A 1-2 ODI series defeat in Bangladesh along with a maiden home ODI series defeat to SA and a 1-1 draw in the T20I series in Zimbabwe was turned around with 3 successes in 3 T20I assignments in the run up to the WC.Like Test class Root,Rahane too can succeed in T20I cricket if given the chance,but for that to happen,Raina,Rohit and Dhawan need to be shown the door

BD fans are happy with their current effort that they forgot that a win against India would have kept them alive in WC! It would have been almost impossible to qualify then but they're are so ignorant about these facts that they're are happy with such close match even if they've lost it! Must appreciate this :)

My man of the match award should go to Dhoni. Here is why.
1) Promoted Pandya above himself. Though it was a minor cameo from Pandya, it was indeed crucial at that time to get quick runs.
2) On the last ball of Indian innings digs out a perfect yorker and immediately takes off for 2 "lucky" runs, inspite of Ashwin shouting "NO" for the 2nd one.
3) Does two swift stumpings to get rid dangerous and settled batsmen  Tamim and Sabbir.
4)Brings in Ashwin at right times to get breakthroughs.(Shakib and Mithun)
5) With his pep talk inspires an off color Bumrah to bowl that excellent penultimate over.
6) After Mushfiqur's catch on 31rd ball of the last over, swaps Dhawan with Jadeja anticipating a running catch at midwicket. Which Jaddu did take of Mahmadullah.
7) Finally right before the last ball takes out his right glove, in anticipation of a bye to be taken and doest'nt throw but runs towards the wickets with the ball to run out Mustafizur.

Dear India fans. While you might be relieved right now after that escape India did nothing for their NRR. The turning wickets they have been playing on will cost them staying in the tournament. It might have seemed like a good tactical ploy to make the pitches like this, but in reality they should have made IPL-style batting friendly pitches. It is called an own goal.

The fact that the pitches are so different makes the tournament a bit of a joke. The pitch Ind v Pak was beyond terrible. Karma will ensure that it comes back to bite India in the @ss.

@DRIFTTURNANDBOUNCE: There is not much difference between the performances of Australia and India in this tournament so far (both shocked by Kiwis and under the pump against BD). Furthermore, Aus DON'T need two straight wins. Due to India's dismal NRR, Aus can lose narrowly to Pakistan and beat India to qualify. I too wouldn't say 'sitting pretty', but India should not be confident making the semis either.

Those who say India is lucky - Remember that Australia was lucky to win 1999 WC when SA lost under similar circumstances. Luck or no luck, India did well to win from a situation where all was lost. For those who did not notice, Yuvraj saved 2 certain fours - 8 crucial runs. He plays from his heart always. Everyone has a bad day. Congrats - MSD for captaincy and the runout as if his life depended on it, Rohit and Dhawan for a decent start, Virat and Raina added useful runs and some catches, Bumrah, Nehra, Jadeja and Ashwin for some tight bowling. Pandya for the important runs and the last over that he bowled. Yuvi for the 8 runs he saved...Had he bowled a great yorker when BD needed 2 off 2 they could have still got a single by dropping the ball on the pitch. The full toss was as if there was divine intervention for India to win and Mahamadullah mistimed his shot. He held his nerve to bowl the last ball just wide enough out of the batsman's reach.Thats teamwork for you and it is notluck

Well that was close , my suggestion for next match drop Dhawan/Rohit and play Pandya as an opener . His timing is good and can middle the ball well. Then we can play either rahane or negi at the lower order.

Margin does not matter for India as winning against Australia will give them 6 points in total. It will be more than Pak/Aus who can get 4 points max if India wins against Australia. It is like quarter-final (Ind vs Aus) for India at least. Also in semi-final and final, run-rate does not matter. Semi-final and final are also similar which are to be won to win the WC.

Now, we have to come to a stage where we are celebrating one run win over Bangladesh. India was playing defensive game from ball 1 , they didn't look like a team that is bothered about NRR. Fielding was pathetic. Bangladesh threw away the match due to lack of experience. Dhawan and Raina should be replaced immediately.

I think Nehra's advice in the penultimate moments forced Bangladesh to throw away an easy win. Nehra should be lauded. Bumrah too compensated for his misfielding with a beautiful 19th over. It could have been won easily by India had they taken care of their batting performance. Hardik Pandya doesn't deserve a place in the team and enough with Dhawan!

As usual after a match I can see many people commenting Dhawan Should go, Pandya should go,Raina Should go ,why Yuvi in the team etc.No use guys ! this is the best available team atm. Dhawan scored a good 23 runs on the difficult wicket. Raina top scorer in the innings good intelligent bowling to trap shabir and Dhoni used the opportunity perfectly and a good slip catch to dismiss Shakib.Pandya a good catch of Mithun and a quick cameo which ended in a wonderful reflex by Soumya. And not forgetting is final over.I am sure Yuvi will perform against Aus

Pathetic batting by 2 set Bangladesh batters. Two bad balls could have been hit anywhere along the ground for four, two or even singles...but no they try to hit a six. Complete lack of game awareness. Doesn't auger  well for India's chances to proceed too far.

Noticed, people are here saying that fans are complaining about inclusion of Pandya, Dhawan, and Raina.. and poor captainship.
</p>
<p>
Its not complaining dear friends, its the fact which we can see on TV, unless until you don't want to accept the truth.
</p>
<p>
Luck may favor the brave but not always, we have been going through these kind of nail biting finish in this World T20 at home, which is not a good sign.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, why curator keep on preparing low scoring pitches for India? 3 in a row, where so much of turn and spin which prohibits our batsmen play freely.
</p>
<p>
Hope, last match at Mohali will be a change.

Ashwin bowled an amazing spell along with Jadeja. He could have gotten another wicket if Tamim's catch wasn't dropped. On such turning tracks Ashwin should only bowl a single over in the powerplay and the remaining 3 overs should be used between overs 8-20 as the ball generally spins much more as it gets older and the pitch takes more turn. Nehra needs to bowl 3 overs upfront as he does not seem to be able to nail yorkers at the death. With Bumrah its the direct opposite. It would work wonders for the Indian team if he is given only 1 over in the powerplay and 3 overs at the death.

Cricket is a multi-dimensional sport where outcomes of matches aren't determined only by batting &amp; bowling performances of competing teams. IND are much stronger team than BD. But victories are secured by converting potential into performances &amp; minimising errors. IND had put a defendable score in the match though BD fielded well. IND should have won the match by about 20/30 runs but for 2 crucial dropped catches &amp; ground fielding errors. Match situation then shifted in favour of BD. BD with persistent positive batting &amp; left-right combination limited effectiveness of IND spinners. In the end BD should have won the match but made tactical batting errors in last over. It was significant for IND that young players (Bumrah &amp; Pandya ) after initial errors showed great resilience to play a crucial role in defending the total in end overs.  MSD unlike many captains wasn't critical on the field that would have demoralised the youngsters. As per cricketing logic Pandya deserved the MOM.

India got out of jail, thanks to silly childish mistakes by BD.  To me, BD controlled this match 99% of the time and yet lost due to this carelessness.  Going forward, I wonder if India deserve to be in SF after this kind of show, especially with the last game against Aussies.  I think Aussies are sitting pretty with 2 games and a much better net run rate, unless they also play like the Indians today and Pakistan reach dizzy heights by playing their usual unpredictable game.  Too many ifs and buts for Indians and Pakistanis to move forward.

Drop Dhawan and get Rahane to open for the next match. If Mohali pitch looks like it will assist seam, I'd drop Raina (who has done nothing with the bat recently) and get Shami in. Yuvraj has atleast shown grit in his knocks (vs Pakistan in Asia Cup and WC)

First of all, congratulations to the Indian team. I feel they are the only Asian team who can handle pressure in tight games apart from the Aussies. Have seen Pak &amp; SA losing so many close games before. It looks BD is going to join their club unless they rectify some of their very basic problems. Nevertheless, I would say- well played BD!. They are already a force to reckon in ODI, hopefully this win will usher in a new era in their t20 prowess too.

Great game to watch as a neutral, must have been nerve wracking for the fans whose teams were involved!  Thought Bangladesh were going to keep counter punching after losing each wicket as they were doing it so well but just went for the knockout punch when not needed.  Well done team India, great escape.

India fielded very poorly in the match. Tamim, Sarkar and Shakib were all dropped off of relatively easy chances and misfielding a few boundaries costing us around 40 runs and an easy victory. In contrast Bangladesh fielded brilliantly saving at least 10-15 runs in the field and Soumya Sarkar's brilliant catch of Hardik pandya was the turning point in our batting innings. Dhoni could have used an extra spinner on such a pitch. Harbhajan could have been as deadly as Ashwin and Jadeja on this pitch. We need to learn a thing or two from New Zealand who have dropped 2 of their best fast bowlers in Boult and Southee to get in the extra spinners in Sodhi and Santner who have been amazing for them.

First of all we should all praise both parties for getting the job done rather perfectly. Both teams executed the provided script perfectly especially Bangladesh.
Lets not beat about the bush we all know that if India is out of the world cup then it means that no more full house stadiums, no more lucrative deals with sponsor hence ICC looses a lot of money and the whole tournament would have been a big failure therefore something had to be done to save the indian team skin hence the last minute script which by the way was perfectly executed by Bangladesh (hats off to them)
my humble suggestion is ICC should ask all the other teams to score 50 or less whenever they play against India (indian board will give compensatory money to ICC and other teams to loose) in any form and bowl indian batsman full tosses every delivery so that they can hit fours and sixes at will and win the match in that way everyone is a winner (indian board, ICC and the other country)

@Vinodgupte - agree with you. It was more a case of bangladesh losing the plot rather than Dhoni's brillinat captaincy which won us the match. I wonder at what point will dhoni stop supporting dhawan, raina etc and actually start picking up players on merit. Luck might favour us at time and Kohli's one man shows might save the day on others but even a casual analysis of the team performances is enough to see that the team is carrying far too many non perfomers. If Kohli fails in the knockout stages, we will most likely be staring at a big defeat.

India have clearly shown why they are number one side . Once again on a hard pitch , they have come up trumps. They kept composure like a champion team does and won crucial moments to win the game. Champion stuff. With Australia next , we need ore such pitches , or say a turner , with that India will end up with an easy win. Australia is struggling and has been poor performers in this tournament as they have been in Asian conditions for past decade or more. India have a sure upper hand in that game. World number 1 India will win.

India should treat this as a loss and make changes to the team. I would get Bhajji and Rahane in place of Yuvraj and Pandya. Against the aussies, two key left handers are Khawaja and Warner. Ashwin bowls in the first six, so Bhajji can bowl in the middle overs. Rahane gives stability better than Yuvi who is not in form.

No body can believe such thing can happen. 1 run to tie, 2 to win with 3 deliveries and four wickets left. Every cricket followers are not yet recovered from this shock.

India as usual were exposed. It is time to relieve Shikar and Yuvi for the Oz match. Yuvi has weakness all over. he is clueless against pace &amp; spin. Fielding and bowling are not up to the mark. Picking Yuvi and Harbajan for this World Cup is a mistake. 
Manish Pandey and Mishra / Chawla 'd have been a better choice.
Hope India realizes soon.

I really don't understand why some people questioning Hardik Pandya's place in the team. He is good enough in all matches he played. He is decent with ball, useful with bat, excellent in field. Who else can replace with such a good all rounder? I really admired by his strong mental state, especially with last over he bowled in this match.
</p>
<p>
Although I really don't like Yuvi out of the game, we need Manish Pandey to replace his place to increase our batting depth. I know Yuvi is useful as part time bowler but we need more consistency in batting. Rahane seems out of form for me.

They have played fearlessly and have developed a lot in the last few years.The only problem is some of the Bangladeshi fans.They show utter disrespect towards other teams.It's good to boast of one's own team performance but please don't disparage other teams achievement. It's because of some Bangladeshi fans that Bangladesh as a team is not getting the respect it deserves from other teams.

What a match!!  So far the most thrilling match in this worldcup. It reminds us the last ball win against Pak in the first ever T20 Worldcup in SA. Full marks to Dhoni for quick thinking and executing the crucial runout. I think India win these type of high voltage matches because they are cool under pressure, thanks to all those last ball/ last wicket matches in  IPL.  Bumrah and Pandya have added value to this team.  Bangla played really well especially their bowlers.  Feel sorry for their fans.

Hi there .... OMG, what a match it was! Still so many fans have needlessly gone into finer details of the match. Those details are there n we should appreciate that but at best they are fickle in nature n that's the beauty of it. But to me it was disappointing to see that so many have failed to appreciate such a thrilling match n it's result. Come on guys, we watch cricket for what then? @some Bangla fans, ur team played good, that's for sure, n we beat u even then. What does this say? I know lots of you guys will be scarred forever... Just kidding.

Poor captainship to say the least.

<p>
How come three in a row, you cant read the pitch, and playing Pandya for no use, only giving lots of run then no or very small contribution in batting (watch since first match against Bangladesh in Asia cup).
</p>
<p>
Sitting Rahane and Manish Pandya then keep on playing Dhawan and Raina. Sitting Bhajji who can bowl much better in these spinning track, and can bat as well.
</p>
<p>
Luck will not be always in your side, make necessary changes where it is due, and learn from Williamson, who had no knowledge on Indian pitches, with taking correct measurement, his team is unbeatable so far.

hey friends using UV and raina is a bit of a gamble on a small ground and also opposition had left handers right through the match if UV boweled it will right in the arc for the left handers that's y dhoni didn't bring UV and raina both are part timers if both went for runs it is very difficult to put pressure on the opposition

The win has got nothing to do with India. The only right thing India did was that they did not drop either catch. Dhoni fanboys talk as if he invented the concept of runout. Any cricketer would have done exactly what Dhoni did on the last ball. It was Bangladesh who wanted to play for the glory and win with a big shot so that this is itched in their memories forever. It was their foolishness which cost them the game. India batted poorly. The pitch was not exactly a batting pitch but IND should have scored 160 at least. Dhoni could not even hit full tosses. A run-a-ball is NOT the return we want from someone down the order. Dhoni played nearly two overs and he should have scored 25 in those many deliveries.

I wud like to differ with the opinion that only rohit, dhawan and raina has failed. in fact they have scored 20s, that too on difficult pitches. Though these contributions may not be sufficient to beat aussies. A couple of batsmen has to fire big way, if we have to beat the aussies. Aus strength is that they have 3 pure batsmen Khwaja, warner &amp; smith and four all rounders Watson, Faulkner, Maxwell, Marsh. All these 4 can do big hitting as well as take care of 10 overs between them which would reduce the pressure on the 3 frontline bowlers. - Nile, hastings &amp; Zampa. If we bat first and post less than 160, it wud be within the reach of these all rounders, as there is a possibility that one of them may fire big. Perhaps we may replace Yuvi with Negi, as Yuvi has not been bowling. result of Pak Aus match is irrelevant to us, given the fact our NRR is very low. Kohli for some reason looked restless during his innings against BD. Hope he gets back to his usual self against the aussies.

I wud like to differ with the opinion that only rohit, dhawan and raina has failed. in fact they have scored 20s, that too on difficult pitches. Though these contributions may not be sufficient to beat aussies. A couple of batsmen has to fire big way, if we have to beat the aussies. Aus strength is that they have 3 pure batsmen Khwaja, warner &amp; smith and four all rounders Watson, Faulkner, Maxwell, Marsh. All these 4 can do big hitting as well as take care of 10 overs between them which would reduce the pressure on the 3 frontline bowlers. - Nile, hastings &amp; Zampa. If we bat first and post less than 160, it wud be within the reach of these all rounders, as there is a possibility that one of them may fire big. Perhaps we may replace Yuvi with Negi, as Yuvi has not been bowling. result of Pak Aus match is irrelevant to us, given the fact our NRR is very low. Kohli for some reason looked restless during his innings against BD. Hope he gets back to his usual self against the aussies.

In the joy of victory, let us not forget the repeated failures of players like dhawan and raina. Dhawan especially has been blessed indeed to have been almost guaranteed a place in the Indian team, regardless of performance. Their regular failures are usually covered by kohli but we cannot rely on one person to bail the team out every time. It is time to drop non performers and select deserving players.

Not bad India. Winning matches inspite of not having the best days on the park, that's good to see. Things are only going to improve and when they do, the winning margins will become comprehensive. The toughest test will be during the Aus match. Aussies are also winning inspite of not being 100%. Whoever wins that match will have the best chance to lift the cup. NZ/WI are just one punch away from a knockout, which I think will be delivered to them in the SF by battle hardened teams like Ind or Aus. Aus/Ind on the other hand have taken punches, rolled with it and are still hanging tough. That's bound to increase their confidence.

Poor cricket by India. Played up to 50% of potential and still won!. Just wonder the idea behind using a pacer like Pandya in a turning track and not using Yuvi and Raina! Dropped catches from everyone!. Need to replace Yuvi/Raina with Rahane and Pandya with Harbhajan in the next match. Very immature celebration from Mushfiqur Rahim after hitting four. He may know the reason now.

BD lost to Dhoni, Dhoni's keeping and captaincy beat BD. As a BD fan I can say it was most exciting match of this WC like last year ODI WC quarter final match. BD now become better opponent of IND rather PAK. Last four-five WC Pakistan loses all matches one sided by IND. On the other hand BD one time beat and one quaeter final and World T20. So give BD proper attention World! Also request Indian fan's to show proper respect to BD. Your player are more mature then BD because you play more matches then BD. BD need to play more match to prove how strong BD is. IND should host BD for full tour not just a test. It will increase the TRP of Star as well.

Bangladesh gave a lesson to the whole world on how not to lose a cricket match.  I think no team will make this kind of mistake in the future for maybe  100s or 1000s of years.

Dhoni's temperament must be the best ever in international sport.
Having taken one glove off to throw, Dhoni took a split second decision to not throw.
Amazing calm and presence of mind under pressure.

Hatts of to Bangladesh, the way they played this match looks like Tiger!! Also, they have superb match against Australia too. In this world cup, out standing performance by team efforts and good cricket award should go to New Zealand and certainly Bangladesh, they fought hard to qualify first and fighting against host nations and giants like Aus. Good to see.  On the other side, Pakistan should not allow to play more cricket due to their bad political cricket and players internal benefit cricket hurting image of cricket. Also need to look purposeful blockage cricket by Srilanka and also India. Bad awards to be presented to Pakistan, Srilanka and India. As a unit they are doing all short of drama and making this game in low level!!!

PARI MOHAN: Ok, you may get another Sachin or Lara or Akram or Warne. Please let us know when you will find.
</p>
<p>
And about Dhoni, he may did show calmness at the last over, or during the match. 
</p>
<p>
But its his foolish act as a captain, we are at this stage in this group. Let us know what was the reason keep playing Pandya on a spinning track, who does not bowl or bat in all the three matches, bowl one &amp;  two overs in earlier as many matches. Last match, he gave away 30 runs in 3 wkts, then keep on playing Dhawan, sitting Rahane, playing Raina where as in form Manish Pandey is sitting at deck. Harbhajan is sitting and watching Pandya is playing as passenger in the team.
</p>
<p>
It was won by India not due to Dhoni, rather foolish act of Bangladeshi batsmen, who were trying to be hero to hit a six. Or else 5 wkts in hand, 2 runs from 3 balls, who will lose the game? Ask yourself.

Looks more and more like an Australia - New Zealand final.  India has too many weaknesses.  Meanwhile the Bangladesh team must be made to walk back all the way to Dhaka as a reward for achieving an impossible defeat.

Come on guys!!! You all have to start enjoying the game CRICKET and stop criticising. The best team in the park wins and that is the reason India won. Bangladesh played fantastic cricket and due credits to them. Ashwin, Bumrah and Dhoni have to get all due credits for what they did. We guys pass expert comments just like that is it???

India was lucky to win. No doubt about that. But Bangladesh were even luckier to reach  to a stage where they could win. India were lacklustre with both bat and ball (barring a few moments of brilliance). It was similar to how Australia played against Bangladesh last game. If India had played to their potential, Bangladesh had no chance to even get close. The pitch was difficult to bat on. It could be seen by the number of chances that went begging during the Bangladesh innings. If any one of the four catches dropped, were taken, the game would have been done and dusted long time back. I could feel that India were under a lot of pressure and they were very cautious with their approach. On the other hand Bangladesh played freely without any burden. This and the last game against Australia were for Bangladesh's to win. But if you cannot win when your opponents aren't at their best, I don't know when will you win.

Tigers were on prowl but the Indian skipper was cool as ice &amp; hats off to Dhawan &amp; Jadeja for taking those pressure catches in last over. Also Hardik deserves some praise, defending 2 from 3 balls against Mushfiq &amp; Mahmudullah was not easy.

I think it's extremely unfortunate that we are calling for the heads of the players representing our country. We won for God Sake. Least we forget  that Pakistan has never beaten us in a World Cup Game. Even Australia doesn't have that record. Bangladesh hasn't beaten us in a T20 ever. Rank turners only go against us when the opposition has Off-Spinners Nathan Lyon, Ajmal during his hay days, Saqlain, Moen Ali. Zampa looks like a good prospect for Australia and Maxwell is a part timer at best. Yes, basis our current form we definitely not contenders, we all agree. But now is the time to stand behind the team. We've won 12 out of 14 T20 matches. It would very surprising if other nations treated their own like the way we do? What more can one expect. Humility at the time of success comes with success. I think the Indian team is humble enough to admit that they need to do more. There is always room to improve, it's a constant process but apologies The flack is definitely uncalled for. If you're an Indian supporter stand behind the time, speak about tactics, support the team on the way forward.  I think that's something we need to learn from our Bangladeshi friends. Even though their team loses more than they win, they support them to the hilt. Strength in numbers people...

Dhoni's calmness is incomparable even to any of the calmest of captains this game has seen, like, steve waugh, richards, Hansie cronje, Ranatunga etc. Only insecured persons will shout out of minds during victories as they think they dont deserve it. Even after winning as many world cups. this guy is all calmness.
You can get another Sachin/Akram/Lara/warne but can never get another Dhoni in cricket
The way he said 'Out' after that last ball without too much emotion or spice shows what this man is upto. Fans of other countries should just admire and enjoy such games, learn the life lesson of composure of players like Dhoni, instead of claiming 'luck' etc. Finally almost everyone is forgetting the role played by Nehra in this game. He mentored every bowler and also guided Dhoni all the way through and that is why Dhoni respects him so much. Its either India or Australia who will win this world cup from her.

Mustafizur should have dived to the crease. If you watch the last ball video clearly, Mustafizur  slows down when he saw Dhoni rushing to the stumps, possibly thinking that Dhoni would lob the ball to the wicket and run him out. So when Mustafizur gives up and slows down, Dhoni kept running and broke the stumps with the ball in his hands.

Coming to the match itself. I think the real man of thr match has to br Dhoni - and by huge margin. The way he maintained his composure and ralkied his troops along was phenomenal! 4 things stood out for me: (1) Creating that stumping out of no where, it was nothing short of miracle (2) Getting Ashwin to bowl that over instead of getting a part timer to do, and thereby effecting Shakib disnissal (3) Giving confidence to Bumrah and Pandya for the last 2 overs and nurturing them along, and finally (4) for that run out in the end - collecting without one glove, running in with pads on, having confidence to outrun a fresh pair of legs with a headstart and to top it all that cool confident reassuring smile to say Out, while we all were holding our breaths for the side on replay! Hats off to the man!! As someone said, there could be another Sachin, another Lara or another Warne, but there could be only one Dhoni! Salute.

Why are you guys criticizing yuvraj? He surely saved 10 runs in the match and he had an off day as good as anyone does with the bat. I still believe Dhawan And Raina be gone for Pandey and Iyer. Then we will say that India Is Invincible!! Dont blame Yuvraj he has rescued India from precariously placed situations a lot of times. One off day does not make him past the So called golden days of his career. Please publish

When aussies won the world cup semifinals against south Africa after the match was tied everyone said aussies were brilliant and fought till the last ball was bowled. When dhoni's India did that against Bangladesh and too with 1 run on hand it is termed as 'luck'. When other teams win a closely fought game it is hyped very much and India does it it is insulted. Anyhow Well done India!!!!!!!!!!. Who ever is think it was luck then those are not fit to know about cricket

India should first have a strategy before they go to the crease. India is having the most vulnerable bowlers compared to all other teams T20I. Batting of India is also struggling and it seems that India is one of the worst teams in this WT20I. India's fielding is also facing problem in their fielding. Dropping 2 easy catches and a good chance of the catch in the first over will be a deciding factor in a low scoring match.

M. Rahim is an overconfident player and that did him in.  He needs to understand he cannot hit the ball out of the park at whim for his size.  I think with his recent form and this particular innings he might well be out of favour.  I thought Litton Das was doing better and where is he now?

@SUBBS_97 I do not understand. BD bowled well , batted well, fielded well , in that case ,why they lost the match. 
Once reaching to super 10 , what happened to paper tigers to loose all the matches. 
It was India who tried to loose this match by throwing wickets , getting out with exceptional watch at wrong time , dropping simplest of catching, over throwing, 
And still manage to win.

As an Indian I find Bangladesh's batting depth on these kind of wickets much superior than India. If you have Mahmudullah and Sarkar batting after loss of 5 wickets then what do you say? They lost due to inexperience and can be very proud of their efforts in the last few years. No fan takes Bangladesh lightly but it will take a few years for them to command a premium like Australia does. Best of luck Bangla you have a great team but bad luck yesterday. India was lucky to win this match after very average batting, fielding and bowling.

As an Indian I find Bangladesh's batting depth on these kind of wickets much superior than India. If you have Mahmudullah and Sarkar batting after loss of 5 wickets then what do you say? They lost due to inexperience and can be very proud of their efforts in the last few years. No fan takes Bangladesh lightly but it will take a few years for them to command a premium like Australia does. Best of luck Bangla you have a great team but bad luck yesterday. India was lucky to win this match after very average batting, fielding and bowling.

Dhoni Kohli = Sanga Mahela. The Indians are lucky that Kohli is here to stay otherwise their team could definitely turn into the current state of the Sri Lankan team.

@SRIKANTHANETHIRRAJ Dhoni is a fantastic t20 captain right behind Williamson. If it wasnt for Dhoni, India wouldnt be winning the games they are winning. India just doesnt have solid talent in their batting lineup. Australia and India are both flat track bullies which is why they are both struggling this world t20. BTW Indian fans dont get your hopes up. If you guys lose to Australia (Which is a high possibility) you guys will be sent packing. If Australia beat India and Pakistan beat Australia, then I believe Pakistan will advance on NRR. Pakistan fans also need to not lose hope even though the state of the team is horrible. Everyones blaming each other and nothing positive is coming out of this world t20 campaign (except maybe the sacking of Afridi and Waqar)

People who are saying Indian batting is bad do not realize that India have been playing on some really tuff pitches whereas other teams like SA,England got 2 matches in Mumbai which is a flat deck.It's pitches like these that are making this Indian team look weak.

Congrats to Bangla team. I thought they were below par in the previous two matches, but the captaincy by Mortaza and the fielding was spectacular. In the end, its just poor shot selection in the last over that cost them, despite being the better team for most of the match.
To those who are saying that Bangladesh did not hold their nerve, do note that they are still improving and are much more mature than before. Earlier, they would just succumb to the pressure of chasing such a total. But they have shown against Pakistan in Asia Cup and against India in WT20 that they can actually chase reasonable totals.

Watched every ball of both games today. Standard of bowling and fielding not great but very exciting cricket anyway. What I cannot understand is Mustafizur Rehman not being able to run a bye off the last ball. Surely he should have been able to beat Dhoni to the stumps?

Congratulation india for narrow escape , it seems  Bd has good potential to knock out india from major tournaments as they already did it twice before 2007wc, 2014 asia cup and today was mighty close to knock india out again ! This was selfishness from our BD batsmen - you need just singles at crucial period yet  you try to be a hero and play high in the air ! However, I congratulate Bd also for playing well without some of their best players such as Taskin, Rubel Hossain , Anamul Haque.

Pandya is no good and does not inspire confidence unlike Bumrah who had a horrendous match conceding a boundary,dropping Tamim's sitter off Ashwin and conceding 16 in the last Power-play over.But he made amends by conceding only 6 in the penultimate over thereby erasing the impact of the last ball four off Nehra's last ball in the 18th over. 2 boundaries in 2 balls even considering Rahim's successful lap sweep show the Bangladesh keeper's field and match awareness and displays Pandya in poor light. Remember Raina celebrating prematurely in a T20I in Australia in January and a similar reaction by Rahim to consecutive boundaries caused the lapse in concentration that led to his dismissal and opened the doors for an Indian win. Mahmudullah's needless hoick superbly caught by Jadeja was the icing on the cake and MSD running out Mustafizur(India's tormentor in the ODI series in Bangladesh in June last year) to secure a narrow 1 run win was poetic justice after India's poor fielding effort.

I think the curators should continue serving these Turner's even against Australia bcoz ausies will outpower us on a flat track just by the quality of power hitters they have.with most batsmen struggling and playing for spots rather than for team I feel it's best to serve a Turner and take in bhajji for pandya and strangle them with spin

If India do not advance to semi, it is Dhoni who has to take full responsibility and step down and be sacked without any sentiment. India did not earn yesterday's win but Bangladesh just gifted it.  Lot of concerns to be addressed because facing Aus.  Obviously, with the present batting unit and the fast bowles Nehra and Bumrah, India cannot beat them. Shami should play at the expense of Nehra.  If Yuvi's bowling is not needed anymore, he should be axed and bring in Rahane who can score at least run a ball. Sorry to say India have very slim chances to advance to semi. However, wish them all the best.

Hats off to the efforts made by Bangladesh specially against Aus and India. India does not look good and strange are they the recent winner of Asia cup?? All eyes on poor batting by Star IPL players Rohit, Dhawan, Kohli, Raina, Yuvraj!!!!!!! I mean this was the match to accelerate run rate and win comprehensively and batters of India make India down once again. Serious concern of all star batsman not playing good cricket!! Time to throw them out, if found purposeful non performance by them. There are many Indian honest youngsters waiting to come to Indian sqaud rather dishonest Star players!!! MSD should be careful now on to trust no more to star players!!!! Need to tightening screws of Selectors who can easily replace Star player with young talents!!!

I know what Mushy and Mahmudulla are going through now. This will haunt them forever. I had a similar situation in my college days in 1976. I still can see that ball when I close my eyes even after 40 years. Hopefully they will turn out to be a better player in future and take this as a lesson.

Congrats to India, MSD, Pandya, Jadeja!! Looks India went to Mirpur to play against Bangladesh, is it ??? I am totally dissatisfied with Indian players specially the batsman poor show!!! Look at the strike rate of all top order Indian batman, averaging 100 around which is not good for t20 cricket. IPL stars like Rohit, Dhawan, Raina, Kohli, Yuvraj should play better cricket of time to say good bye to all of them. How much one man army MSD and young boys (Pandya, Bumrah, Nehra) can do more to save the matches in big world cup??? I am feeling instead of Ashvin against Aus, try Harbhajan if needed as his home ground and he can be better against aus. while ashvin giving away too many runs against aus in past. Showcaser kohli is showing all his class against Pak and look at him his second home pitch of RCB, he is having below ordinary batting causing india less score too!!!! India do not want any more stars like Rohit, Kohli, India need MSD and 100 % honest youngsters to follow Great MSD!!!

Rahane supporter is clearly targeting any single failure from Yuvraj. If Dhoni doesn't allow him to bowl in spin friendly pitch then its Dhoni fault not his. I am not sure as why Rahane was selected when india had better T20 batsman in form of Manish Panday. Rahane should focus only for test cricket. He has been given so many chances and never proved his credentials with any strong match winning performance. Definitely, Pandya isn't suited for spin friendly pitch and Harbhajan was better choice for this match but Dhoni keeps going his own way and style. He would have been critisized if India had lost this match. Dhoni isn't good in good utilization of resources but going with same warhorse. So, rest of matches, it will be same team no matter what.

The turnaround for India started when Bumrah, who earlier had to endure a bad day on the field, bowled those wonderful yorkers in the 17th over and then complemented it with similar efforts in the 19th over of Bangladesh innings. The catches by Kohli, Dhawan, and Jadeja towards the end and Dhoni's intelligence in running out the batsman in the last delivery of the match sealed the match in India's favor. Having said that, with just two runs needed of three balls, Bangladeshi batsmen really blew it with a rare piece of unthinking cricket in the last over of their innings. To Team India's credit, they held their nerves, executed their strategies well in the final stages, and richly deserved the win.

Contrary to everyone's perception that India moved a step closer to semifinal spot,  I feel that it is not like that.  India's fate now lies in beating the aussies. Even if they had lost to BD they would have a chance by beating aussies.  It is because there is no great improvement in the NRR during the win against BD.  Other than helping a clean slate against BD this win did not do much in advancing India's cause towards getting semifinals spot only because there is no planned assault to increase the NRR

Luck was on Bangladesh side, India dropped crucial catches, misfielded and did everything to lose the game.. But Bangladesh did everything to waste the good luck they had and ended up on the losing side...  Any other team including Hongkong /Nepal could have probably scored 2 runs of 3 balls easily considering the fact their two most accomplished batsmen were at the crease...

First of all,yes India was lucky in those last 3 balls.BUT,we took it to the last over even after BD required only 7.5 rpo in last 3 overs with their best finisher on crease.

For India it is a very simple equation now - they cannot qualify unless they beat Australia. Assuming there is a result in the PAK vs AUS match, this will put one of those teams equal on points with India, but above India on NRR. Therefore, anything but a win in the final pool watch will mean elimination for India. The result of the PAK vs AUS match is important to Pakistan - they also must win that match to have a chance of qualifying because then they will finish on 4 points and a loss will mean elimination. Australia, on the other hand, can still lose to Pakistan and it will then all come down to their final match against India. However, they must avoid losing to Pakistan by a large margin or they will need to win big over India to overtake Pakistan on NRR.

Great brand of cricket, the best of the tournament so far I guess. Probably the thought process of Bangladeshi batsmen was right. A desparate approach appropriately  at the beginning of 20th over brought them that close....logically they wanted to avoid the desparate situation needing 2/3 from last ball. I dont think it was heroics.  When you get  full tosses on 4rth or 5th ball should never wait for the next ball. 6th ball, as was proved in this case was the best ball of the over. As batsman you never want to leave it for next ball because you dont know whats coming next. I think that was the plan...sadly did not work. Best thing is they never thought of leveling the score with a cautious approach. It was way more than loosing...no less than winning. proud of the tigers and their brave brand of cricket. Well done India and cool old leader Dhoni. lucky though!

When aussies won the world cup semifinals against south Afric after the match was tied everyone said aussies were brilliant and fought till the last ball was bowled. When dhoni's India did that against Bangladesh and too with 1 run on hand it is termed as 'luck'. When other teams win a closely fought game it is hyped very much and India does it it is insulted. Anyhow Well done India.  You have done us proud especially the presence of mind of Dhoni in removing his right glove. How many captains or wicketkeepers would have done this?  But there are still some sore points in his captaincy like persisting with yuvi and dhawan and raina.  India lost golden opportunity to nurture youngsters like Shareya Iyer Manish pandey etc who were not even selected due to India's perseverance with dhawan raina and yuvi. I don't think it will be an easy climb for Dhoni from now on with this team

BD is lucky to have lost it by only one run. Remember the misfield by Bumrah on the first ball of BD innings, when he allowed the ball to go for four, when it should have been only one run. That is three extra lucky runs for BD. Then again Bumrah should have held that dolly of a catch of Tamim when he was only on 18. Tamim went on to make 35, which is 17 extra runs! Therefore, if luck had not favoured BD at crucial moments, they would have lost by at least 17+3=20 runs. And I have not included the extra runs which the catch dropped by Ashwin cost India. So luck favoured BD more than India in this match. Dhoni, at least had the presence of mind to run to the wicket to run out the batsmen. That is hard work, and certainly not luck. What was the need for BD players to try to hit sixes when they needed only 2 runs from 3 balls?

For all those saying that Indian victory is fluke must understand that India scored 146 and BD scored a run lesser. Win is a win even if it's from last ball of the innings. Dhoni made a tactical mistake by giving 2 overs to Hardik Pandya which costed 20 runs. On such a track where Ashwin was turning square, Raina would have bowled very well with nothing above 15 runs in those 2 overs.

Bangladesh under Mashrafe look very ominous and improved especially between the ears. They seem to have the self-belief to win against better teams. The way they kept coming at the Ind bowlers is proof that they were not going to back down. So kudos to them for the quality of cricket and tactics when bowling. Chopped off scoring options for Rohit &amp; Dhawan who were just one-dimensional and brainless to counter or come up with Plan B. Blindly hitting out ,these days even minnows don't do that. OTOH Dhoni was a complete contrast,showed no appetite for new tactics.Same team same liabilities and non-performers who thrust the whole responsibility on a couple of players to bail them out. Raina even with 30+ looked scratchy and does not inspire confidence at such a key position. Yuvraj sadly failed after a valuable knock against Pak. Something else is bothering him because if its touch he's played 12 games to have gotten it back. Hats off to Bumrah for coming back after initial disaster.

I don't understand why Bangladeshi fans and their captain are talking about luck factor. India played bad cricket in this game, but Bangladesh were worse. If any team was lucky it was Bangladesh, for getting misfields and dropped catches from this Indian side. In the end it all came down to handling pressure and kudos to dhoni and team India for holding their nerve till the very end. All in all a fascinating game of cricket.

All Australian world cup series are won like this, they are the favourites and then they lose dramatically, get into a situation of up against the wall, they will find a one hero to do that miracle, and boom they play as a unit in the final decimate that all perfect opponent and take the cup home. It was never the amazing NZ, to cross the semifinal, they are the good boys that never make it. It's that back bench naughties that will win it in the end. Good luck India, you are now the back bench naughty with all the potential but not enough application. Peak in the right time, Win the World Cup Sublime...

India have clearly shown why they are number one side . Once again on a hard pitch , they have come up trumps. They kept composure like a champion team does and won crucial moments to win the game. Champion stuff. With Australia next , we need ore such pitches , or say a turner , with that India will end up with an easy win. Australia is struggling and has been poor performers in this tournament as they have been in Asian conditions for past decade or more. India have a sure upper hand in that game. World number 1 India will win.

No doubt that BD gifted the victory to INdia, but no praise will be more for MSD who kept his cool and composure which rubbed on to his team mates. I had alrady mentioned yday that BD are no pushovers. Some comparison can be made to the last over bowled by joginder in the T20 final in 2007. Gauging by the performances, India is no longer favourites in this tournament. Irrespective of what happens in the Aus vs Pak match, India has to win the match aginst Aus, which is a tough ask. Slow turners have not helped India, as our batsmen struggled to score runs. I felt MSD was the man of the match, rather than ashwin. I am a little bit surprised why Yuvi has not been called up to bowl in the middle overs, which wud have given better options to him in the end overs. But then mSD knows better than any other former captains or the experts / analysts, having captained India for so many years and matches in all formats. Hope India will beat aus and go thru to SF. All the best

Many of you saying that India don't deserve to win. Yes, until the last three balls but when a team couldn't score 2 runs off 3 balls doesn't deserve to win either. This match is an example of how to stay calm in tense moments. And I want to congradulate BD for their excellent game for 39.3 overs. This is India's second wake up call and I believe that India have woken up to play their best game against the Australians.

This win should fill Ind will confidence and self-belief but the problem is Oz will batter this bowling and if our batsmen fail again there won't be enough to defend. Because Australians will be professional and wont gift matches like BD did. Rohit and Dhawan were again pathetic and Dhoni just does not show any flexibility in selection or decision making. His batting was awful and dropped a catch to balance the outstanding stumping and run out. His time's up and he knows it too.Hope for his and India's sake he goes on a better note. Cant fathom our batting struggling to put together a 160+ score no matter what the experts say about pitches. No big hitters in the team apart from Pandya who can take the game away with lusty blows. Was unlucky today due to a freak catch. Praying that Pak beats Oz and we beat Oz just to make sure RR won't be a factor in our advancing to SF. Interesting Ashwin made a point about not being contenders,tells a thing or two about their state of mind.

Congrats to India, but i felt they are playing bad cricket, they are not building up partnerships, trying too hard to score big on home soil, it just needs 7-8 sixes to reach 160, they are trying to hit every second ball and loosing on singles, on yesterday's match all of you who are praising BD,  remember India had a really bad game yesterday, batting was all over the place, so was fielding, they got off to a flier, for Bangladesh to look good other teams will have to perform badly, i love cricket and i really want them to perform well but they are just above associate nations. If India doesnt get things right on Sunday..... U all know the results

The Indian openers are really messing up things for middle order. The super slow starts they give in power plays and then throwing away their wickets is putting pressure on middle and lower middle order to accelerate score ! I would rather send Pandya to open be it pinch hitting or what ever. The fielding was pathetic. There were mis-fields and awful number of dropped catches ! Indian team certainly do not deserve the cup on comparing with NZ, WI by the way they are progressing in the tournament. There is no consistency in Rohit Sharma, Raina, Shikhar Dhawan's batting performance. Rohit needs to keep his head still and focus on batting and try to be consistent . Ashwin need to stop talking big and being overconfident at press and concentrate on fielding and bowling ! Yuvi needs to take some responsibility and respect his wicket as he is known for finishing game well if he is set at crease for a while.

BD team is going to take sometime to come out of this defeat. regardless of the bravado of all the fans, it must hurt. If after india's worst day and with the dropped catches and fielding lapses, you cannot win against a team, then it is very poor on your nerves. BD had all the luck and their foolishness blew it away. A very good match in the end and the right experience for Indian team. They have learned that if they hold their nerve, then can come back even on their worst day. never give up till last the last second. Dhoni has a real calm head. Unbelievable.

Feel sorry for the BD team and the fans, this match was in the bag and the over bowled by Pandya was actually very poor. The aerial shots were risky but they were invited by rank bad deiveries.  Bad luck that they landed in hands of the fieders. BD will have to move on and take lessons from here. They are becoming a really good team and the results will start flowing too, soon enough. Well played.

This was the testimony of Bangladesh unable to handle pressure by poor shot selection when it really mattered! I am afraid this is the next level up against the bigger boys in handling pressure. If we were able to cope with pressure then we would have won against Australia and India. We would have had one foot in the semi-finals by now.

BD, if with so much luck going your way, you cannot win, that is poor. 3 dropped catches and fielding lapses by india and still !. India lost the game early on, and then won it back in the end thanks to BD players emotional harakiri. Indian fielding had a bad day. But of coz if those 3 catches were taken, we wouldn't have had such a close and scintillating finish. This is the kind of match, that would boost the confidence of a team as you have clinched a victory from defeat. India looks more as favorites to me now.

It was an incredibly exciting match. Bangladesh was unlucky to lose despite dominating most of the match. Dhoni needs to get his selection right for the crucial match vs Australia. His batsmen, barring Kohli, are not firing in this WC.

Lady luck stopped smiling at Bangladesh as their brain faded to score 2 runs from 3 balls with their best finisher still in crease. On the other hand India sneaked through with their hunger to move forward. What a drama!!! 3 dropped catches and edgy fours, still BD could not win!!!

Its a shame that Bangladesh Lost. They bowled well and fielded like champions. They saved at least 15 to 20 runs on the field . India batting is woefully bad . Whether India progresses to the next stage or not, this team requires a face lift and we are carrying a lot of baggage. Am an Indian fan, but I feel not good at all by the win yesterday.

Yuvraj is clearly out of form... he doesn't fit to the role India is looking from him... Since Dhoni is also not giving him the ball, India can choose any 3 players-Rahane, Bhajji or Negi in place of Yuvraj.... Just to think Yuvraj is a proper batsman in paper will not work... Bhajji &amp; Negi are both lower order basher and we expect 2-3 overs from them every match... in case of bhajji we may get 4 overs as well... We cannot rely on Pandya more than 2 overs... If Dhoni still thinks he need a batsman, then go with Rahane... This is World Cup and just ot show faith on a player and loose a WC, doesn't worth... Yuvraj's game is better suited for ODI.. where he will take some time to settle and then accelerate... Also Dhoni needs to come at 4.....

every one seems to be taking on hardik pandyas bowling figures but nobody noticed how he batted if he would have stayed on for few more overs score would have been easily over 160 and remind you his dismissal was absolute fluke

It's a shame Bangladesh lost.  But I am really pleased to see their spirit. After all the dramas they have gone through in the last few days, they really have earned my respect for great showing. They play their cricket like the way Argentines (with passion and emotion) play their football as opposed to the Germans (machine like). I know sometimes it may come out as though they are over doing it, but trust me it comes from the passion they have for the game and the love for their country. Not everyone express their emotion same way. It's really good to see peace in here among the fans from all sides. Great advertisement of the game of cricket!!

For those who are saying India was lucky, mind you Tamim and BD Team was lucky that he was dropped by Bhumra very early. If he would have caught it BD would have wrapped up much earlier. Guys it's not being lucky it's being thoughtful and playing right cricket at right Tim that wins you matches

I can't wait to see what type of pitch the Indians throw up for the game against Australia now that they are in danger of being eliminated. There is no way the BCCI or its groundsman are going to allow India risk being eliminated early in a tournament held in their own country even if they might deserve it.

I am surprised so many people here feel it was luck and India doesn't deserve to win. A WIN is a WIN. What happened to England to have luckily scraped through with AFG l, the same England which chased 230 against SA. Nothing wrong in being lucky. India will be in Semis and in Finals also. I won't be surprised if India takes the Cup home and people still call it luck. Running 15 metres in and running out a batsman  is not luck. Guys like we appreciate every team on their good performance, give dye credit to India also.

Bangladesh played a very good game and deserved a win here, as they were in control for most of the match. They were winning till the last three balls. They planned well and executed well (very well in bowling). The Indian batsmen lost their wickets when they went for big shots (big swings). The ball was sticking to the pitch and Bangladesh served excellent and well disguised slow balls. On this wicket, you need to wait for the ball and place it preferably with ground strokes. Bowling first worked out well for Bangladesh. India were poor in tactics and execution again, they really did not deserve to win this match with the way they played. As said after the last India match, Kohli will not be delivering every match (in T20s you can only count on it so much, in this series our most consistent batsman could only deliver one out of three matches). I feel Indian batsmen have been trying too hard this series, losing their calm and making too many mistake.

With NZ already in the semis...their bench players may play in the last game vs Bangladesh.  They are just as good as anyone in the starting eleven so there is no let off.  In my opinion they have the best all round team in the tournament, Ish Sodhi has been a peasant surprise!

As a neutral I have to say I enjoyed watching that game but as a Cricket fan I also have to say I really hope Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah feel ashamed for playing such idiotic shots which have cost Bangladesh a win and I hope Mushfiqur feels embarrassed for celebrating as if the game was already won when he got the 4 that meant Bangladesh needed 2 off 3.

It was BD's to lose and they did. As an Indian, feel relieved,re-invigorated only because losing to BD and bowing out of a home tournament would have been disastrous and unfair. As Mahela said, our batsmen have been unlucky not to have gotten a proper batting pitch in the 3 games. MSD redeemed himself today with gloves at-least and the run out though still dropped a catch and let that 4 in last over. Pathetic batting again by Dhawan &amp; Rohit. With this batting display cant see them reaching SF as Oz will pummel them and God forbid if we have to defend against them too. Comes down to luck with RR coming into play.Prior to the event I thought top 3 will score big but bowlers would let down but turned the other way around. Bowlers have won us 2 games even if they were spinning tracks. Unless we kick off in first 6 overs we just cannot post enough totals to defend.

Luck, sheer luck. The Indian team is going from bad to worse. Luck winning the toss against Pakistan and choosing to bowl. This is the only thing running the Indian team right now, that and Virat. Today Virat got out early and see  what happened

I was so shocked that Bangladesh did not try to tie the game first with 3 balls left! I was watching the game a kept shouting "tie first". Too bad both Mushfiqur and Mahmudulluh lost their head at a time when calmness was needed. India got off by a whisker.

Most of our top order batsmen r out of form, in spinning track three in a row, Harbhajan Singh sitting on bench, this captain keep on playing Pandy, who contributed 30 runs from his 3 overs. How then we expect team will win, when our fielders dropping dolly catches to allow them score freely in such a below par score chase? Now, the only way India may go to semi is to beat Aus, no NRR will work for now with this pathetic win.

Congrats to Dhoni &amp; Co. So far there is 605 comments published and even in India Pakistan game could not generate so much chatter. I guss it is good at least people are noticing Bangladesh. BD fans pls do not bad mouth Musi and Riyad. They are more hurt than us. We may forget this but untill we can beat India tjis day will forever hunt them. To Indian fan we as a bd fan can some time go overbaord with our expectations but you have understand we are no more a push over. The fans who are saying that we are below Afghanistan please know that so far it is 2-1 if memory serves me right. Afghans are very good team and they are improving rapidly.  We should be humble win or lose. At the end of the day it is a game and looks like the players are really good friends. So why can't we be civil. Cheers.

I cannot congratulate India.  India is a bad team for this WC.  This was a game that Bangladesh lost and not India won. I believe that WI and NZ are the only well performing teams in this WC.  All others are hit or miss.

Just unbelievable, I did not watch the match after the first couple of boundaries.  Today morning, when I just checked the news I was shocked.  It is BD losing rather than India winning this one.  Though the match was a masterclass, India's poor show with the bat and fielding attributed to this.  They still stay in the hunt which I think they don't deserve it.  You need to thank BD for this one.

how could BD mess this up?! India didn't deserve to win this match but BD made a even bigger mess! Beyond reason that Dhoni isn't letting Yuvi bowl still having him in playing XI, Dhoni is getting away cos India is winning.  I am Indian but dont see India as deserved kavs anymore. Need to up the game Team India!!

Now I know now Mushy and Muhmudulla both can never be a good finisher. A good finisher looks for a single in a situation like this. Anyway, IND should look at this now and say "did we just play a quarter or a Semi final?"

BD fans commenting on India's victory as "luck" should see the amount of dropped catches and "life"s BD team got during the match and analyse for themselves who were lucky ? BD would have been short of atleast 10 to 15 runs had those catches been taken ! Dhoni and entire team's presence of mind, cool head, pressure handling abilities at the end of the match earned us the victory and not luck. Dhoni removed his right hand glove at the last ball of the match that made him not to fumble when he collected the ball at pressure situation and hold the ball and hit the stumps. It is these kind of things that makes champion player. BD were lucky with wild hitting. When they needed 2 off 3 balls all they needed to do was to get single and level score and then go for big shot ! The lack of this  experience is what differentiated between India and BD. What BD batsmen need to learn is "dancing down the track" is not the only way to play aggressive shots ! There is something called "stand n deliver"

Hats off to MSD for keeping his cook at the crucial juncture. Dropped catches had almost cost them the match, but the Indian boys managed to pull this win this from an impossible situation. Well played BD, you guys stayed on course till the very end. 19th over by Bumrah, set it all up. Mushfiqur nearly made a match out of it. But the celebration came a bit too early and the lapse in focus cost the match for BD. The real hurdle for India is just around the corner now. The batsmen has to fire or else we will need a miracle as this one one to pull it through. All the best boys. Cheers!

Congrats India and BD. BD played well but couldn't finish it. Lot of people are saying that Dhoni's captain ship win the match, but actually he was the one who created the situation.. right from team selection, the way he used the bowlers and choice of bowlers made things worse for India. But it is his keeping skill that helped us to win the match - The stunning stumping showed his sharpness and presence of mind and the last ball run out, he did it in his own style. It was a fight between Dhoni's CaptainShip and Keeping skills and the later won. Sorry BD. Better luck next time.

Rather than to say India won, its Bangladesh who lost ! But looking at the other side, Bangladesh need to respect ICC and other country administration to move on. Taskin and Arafat were banned because they had an illegal action period. They were reported by on field umpires and this has nothing to do with India or BCCI period. Be humble and show support to the team and they will improve and don't celebrate too early like Mushfiqur !

Dhoni was lucky. Plain and simple. Now, I am usually a Dhoni fan, but his bowling changes could not have been worse. When Ash had Sowmya on the strings, why not give to Raina to mount the pressure? Why not sneak in Yuvi with an over when 2 RH at crease? Got lucky to get wickets through full tosses by Nehra, Pandya. Also, Ash is better batsman than Jadeja esp on such tracks. Why not promote him. Too many mistakes. Doesn't sound like recepie for success.

Bangladesh has improved because of mash not for hature.
1. nature is also the coach of test side captained by mushi and pathetic team like old times.
2. mash is the captain of 20/50 format coached by hature and look the difference.
3. nassir has long been ignored by nature for the national team but he performed a team tour to India being man of the tournament.
and man of the tournament of last years bcl.
mind it.

for those of you who think Ind won because of luck let me remind you. It was not luck. it was poor performance of BD batsman under pressure that helped India win. Luck is when uncontrolled events happen such as rain, wrong decision by umpire. It was not India's luck that BD batsmen played poor shot. It as India's experienced captain cool and well executed plan that worked in their favor.

Too close for comfort from Indian team point of view , this is 4th or 5th time in last one month  when our (Indian) much maligned bowling line up has bailed out our "mighty" line up , i don't want to go on about how X played should be dropped or Y should have been there .... but surely some of them can learn something from the positive  and confident mindset displayed by Hardik Pandya.On a lighter note if the current team Indian team had to field a 100 x 4 relay team then i am guessing Ashwin,Nehra and Bumrah's name won't be there ..... Bumrah might be a terrific death bowler but he is a liability on the field.

Lucky escape for India.  Not much difference between these two teams nowadays.  The pitches here in India have generally been rather poor for T20 cricket and make low-average bowlers seem like geniuses.  They need to lift the standard of the pitches in the final series.

If Taskin was there, India would had been all out for 50 [just like in some previous matches vs BD] and then BD would had chased that in 9 balls.

well, another MSD classic. he is not like a boss, he is the boss. but still i am not sure about yuvi. i mean he is still a top player. but he is not suitable at 5, 6 or 7.  rayudu could have done better.

Irony of this match is BD fans/players will remember this most rather than lost agaist India in Asia cup final..
Only thing I want to say is rohit should respect his wicket..India needs him to play more than powerplay..for dhawan even if he playes as long as powerplay but he is the one should accelerate not rohit..rohit playes so good in middle overs..I bet if he plays with rohit till 12,14 overs dhoni will promote pandya ahead of all others..pandya really hit hard..today he was out by sensational catch..if he gvs us 30-40 runs in middle overs at more than 200 strikerate it can set platform for dhoni,raina,yuvi..

Mr. Finisher is not a Mr. Finisher indeed. Today's match reminded me of the 2012 Asia Cup final. We had lost to Pakistan in the same manner. When the batsman in the team with the coolest brain looses his brain, this type of thing is bound to happen. Just like Dhoni pointed out after the match, about Mahmudullah. THE FINISHER, NEEDS TO TAKE A LESSON FROM THIS.

I guess the pre-mature celebrations of Mussi typifies the mentality of BD fans, the team and its board. They happily jump to conclusions which suit them most. And this is reflected in all their endeavors, be it today's match, questioning ICC's intentions by their coach on Taskin ban, the WC 2015 debacle with IND match and not the least, their outrageous fans hyping the team and cursing others.
This match should be a tough pill for them to swallow for all the odds as well as luck was in their favour but still they couldn't make it. IND was in real soup due to their own faults and this was a golden chance to beat us and brag for ever, but it didn't happen.
I would suggest them to get rid of their IND hatred else there would be many more of such pills, even in this tourney.
Best of luck to team IND and "safe travel" to BD.

And this is reflected in all their endeavors, be it today's match, questioning ICC's intentions by their coach on Taskin ban, the WC 2015 debacle with IND match and not the least, their outrageous fans hyping the team and cursing others.
This match should be a tough pill for them to swallow for all the odds as well as luck was in their favour but still they couldn't make it. IND was in real soup due to their own faults and this was a golden chance to beat us and brag for ever, but it didn't happen.
I would suggest them to get rid of their IND hatred else there would be many more of such pills, even in this tourney.
Best of luck to team IND and "safe travel" to BD.

The probability of BD losing to India by a single run is zero for all practical purposes. But everything is possible in T20.

Expected a good article here. But this write-up doesn't do justice to such a wonderful match. The important moments of the match are stated in a matter-of-fact, ever-so-casual way concealing the kind of atmosphere it was actually effecting on everyone.

Put aside that rivalry for the future.What mouthwatering rivalry we have ahead in this WT20 especially If Australia beats Pakistan in 25th,we will have a virtual quarterfinal between India-Australia on Sunday 27th.Aussies beat India in the final to win 2003 ICC WC,India beat Australia in semis on their way to winning 2007 WT20,India again beat them in quarterfinals on their way to winning 2011 ICC WC and Aussies got their revenge 4 years later by beating India in the semis to win 2015 ICC WC.It doesn't get much better than this in ICC tournaments these days,India-Australia knockout match.

Key factors:
1. India dropping catches
2. Excellent second spell by Bumrah
3. Good Captaincy by Mortaza
4. Brass balls of Panday in the last over
5. Last but not the least one word DHONI!!!

Australia pretty much convincingly beat Bangladesh in last game, and yet haters called Aussies an average side.What to make out of Indian team now? Shear mindless cricket in last three balls by top Bangladesh batsmen kept India in tournament. India is not the strongest team in this World Cup for sure. WI and Eng are stronger sides, it will be interesting what Aussies do against Pak, will they shine or will they collapse. Interesting time ahead

Yes, India won, but by some good fortune. The game shows how poor India's bowling are in their own home ground! They should bring one more spinner. Bangladesh lost the match because of some mindless batting, but again a win would give them nothing. NZ and AUS vs WI and SAF would make the tournament more justified.

Bangladesh fans again calling their no.10 status to save their  face after a defeat. God, anyone would agree,  that  Bangladesh played the most immature cricket in the last 3 balls. Now what Bangladesh fans are going to say after back to back defeats in the hands of Indian team? They would find some self pitying comments. That's all they can manage. They have to understand  that a cricket match is not won by their team until and unless their team has managed to score at least one run more than the opposition  team. Very simple in't it? Now they can play qualifying  round with Oman , Ireland, Iceland, Republic of Antarctic etc ...

605 comments on here at ~ 1600 Central US time and 35 on the ENG-AFG board. Yep that is about right. There is no denying the gravity pull of the centre of the cricket universe I guess. I would say at least now IND controls its destiny. Beat Oz and they are in. No need to worry about NRR if they do that. Lose to Oz and the winner between Oz and PAK is in. I'm expecting Australia to thump PAK. I think they just match up too well with them. NZ vs. BAN is irrelevant and perhaps based on who is going to be seeded where in the other group a good chance for my lot to "rest some players". You would have to believe NZ would love to play England in the SF over either of SA or WI. But for the poms to get the 1 seed they would have to absolutely maul SL. International tournament T20 is so much more palatable than the franchise/bilateral stuff for a test snob like me. You couldn't have scripted todays finish no matter how hard you tried. There are roads in the Urals with fewer twists and turns.

The last over has been dissected already I. The sub continent and uk channels and seems that everyone is reading from the same script. Howver I liked it when one analyst said that no umpire would give the last Pandya ball as wide, in a tournament held in India where the decision could get India kicked out of the World Cup. I think that's rather telling ...

@THERIPPER this guy SAI SHENOY obviously has some point of fact which always hurts IND'n fans that furious Taskin is bowling better than than all Mashrafe, Al Amin &amp; Rony since Asia cup let go Mustafizur for a while as he just came back from side strain &amp; not totally fit but still not bowling bad...no need to go back to Asia cup.. if in form Bumrah was out of this team then BD would finish it with at least 3 overs to spare...So Taskin also matters for BD

BD were exceptional for 39.3 overs today. Immaculate fielding, bowling, field placements, batting - EVERYTHING. If they did not have the brain fade in the last 3 balls, this was their match. Indian fielding was NOT as good as it generally is. Their bowling and batting were as usual - nothing extra ordinary. It is their poor fielding that nearly cost them the match. They dropped two sitters, two difficult catches and one impossible one! Also, India misfielded a single to FOUR. Although I am an Indian, I am sorry for the BD fans. They really deserved to see their team win today. But they can be proud that their team can not be considered underdogs anymore.

From Indian Fan,  Yes I am relieved that India won this match somehow... but what a bad performance from India!!! Remember this match is played against Ban.. who were in qualifier...

Happy but sad with the way we played!!!

I must say BD performed much more than capability and Ind underperformed but still a good result for Ind to get those 2 points. I just wonder why SA is never on the finishing line in such situations in the past. Hoping for SA to make to the semis. But still Eng a big threat to become the 2nd team to go through. From Grp Ind NZ seem the 2 best team.

For those who are insulting BD by saying IND struggled against a minnow - IND soundly thrashed Aus and other asian teams recently in their own backyard. SA struggled in T20s against IND. NZ is the only team who are in hot form. With couple of changes in batting lineup IND can be tough to beat in semis and finals. This can be the turning point mate!

A thrilling victory for India...Until last over it was Bangladesh who were dominating the match.  The last over was dramatic when Bangladesh who needed two runs from three balls lost cool by losing three wickets while scoring only two runs.  This lucky victory keeps alive India`s chances of reaching semi finals.

Coming from an SL fan : Dhoni's calmness is incomparable even to any of the calmest of captains this game has seen, like, steve waugh, richards, Hansie cronje, Ranatunga etc. Only insecured persons will shout out of minds during
victories as they think they dont deserve it. Even after winning as many 
world cups. this guy is all calmness. 
</p>
<p>
You can get another Sachin/Akram/Lara/warne but can never get another Dhoni
in cricket
</p>
<p>
The way he said 'Out' after that last ball without too much emotion or spice shows what this man is upto. Fans of other countries (including my fella SL fans) should just admire and enjoy such games, learn the life lesson of composure of players like Dhoni, instead of claiming 'luck' etc.
Finally almost everyone is forgetting the role played by Nehra in this game. He mentored every bowler and also guided Dhoni all the way through and that is why Dhoni respects him so much.
Its either India or Australia who will win this world cup from her.

Best position for pinch hitter is no.3 and that's where Pandya, Ranchi Rhino, Jadeja, Ashwin should bat. If pinch hitter is successful V.Kohli is presented an opportunity to take the score to 200+ and if pinch hitter is un-succesful V.Kohli knows how to bat in usual manner. Considering pitch, not allowing Yuvraj or Rohit Sharma to bowl was not a wise decision. In future matches, if pitch requires, then Harbhajan could be included in place of Shikhar Dhawan and Pandya or Jadeja could be asked to open. This may sound strange, but pitches on which India has played have been very bad and no one knows how many times Indian team will be lucky. Pandya with ball in this match, reminds of Hrishikesh Kanitkar with bat in Dhaka in 1998 .

@tjk1, assuming of course, Pakistan beat Australia, Australia beat India , they all end up with 4 points, Pak goes through because of superior run rate , India has the worst RR of three...lets wait and see.

What are Indian cricket coaches and decision makers are still thinking...?
</p>
<p>
Here is my solution to win the games. Hope Dhoni and team at least read this.
</p>
<p>
1. First 5-6 overs, speed up.... letting you know in simple english. 
</p>
<p>
2. if opener's are afraid for # 1 above, send someone who doesn't really care to lose his wicket.. send Jadeja or Ashwin or someone else.

3. REMOVE Yuvraj . This is really critical. Again saying in simple english. get chance to someone like Rahane or Negi. 
</p>
<p>
4. Dhoni and boys need to watch tapes/videos to analyse how those other teams who scores 200+ runs and learn &amp; come up with game plan... 
</p>
<p>
5. game plan should not be to keep wickets till the end. Game plan should be to score 200+.. again it's in plain english, can it be more simpler than that ?
</p>
<p>
Go India..
</p>

What are Indian cricket coaches and decision makers are still thinking...?
</p>, <p>
Here is my solution to win the games. Hope Dhoni and team at least read this.
</p>, <p>
1. First 5-6 overs, speed up.... letting you know in simple english. 
</p>, <p>
2. if opener's are afraid for # 1 above, send someone who doesn't really care to lose his wicket.. send Jadeja or Ashwin or someone else.

@washif To add to my earlier comment, even if Pak or Aus win their next match, they are still not guarantees a semi spot, that means only WI can become the second team to qualify after playing 3 matches.

Bangalore is one heck of a lucky ground for India. I still remember Venkatesh Prasad of all the bowlers getting Amir Sohail out when he had been belting our bowlers all around the park and somehow Pakistan contrived to loose that match. Same ground.

Indian cricket team has been winning in recent past mostly because of accurate bowling and this close win against BAN does not surprise me at all. In twenty twenty cricket at least one batsman has to score in blitzkrieg manner like ABD, Gayle, Root, Maxwell are scoring. When was the last time Indian batsmen were comfortable and scored freely ? Has any Indian batsman scored twenty ball fifty in this world cup ? India could have easily won the match against NZ, if at least two batsmen had scored quick thirties and remaining batsmen just gathered around them. And what to say of Indian pitches, they are worst pitches team can ever find.

Its takes an MS to hit out the match ... Probably the crucial question that the entire B'desh team should have asked themselves is exactly that... "Should I hit India out of the park... Or should I work the ball around and play safe?". Its not a fluke that MS hits amazing shots in the death and does it in style.. Its a testament to his experience and sheer discipline and not just swinging the bat at anything and everything without regard to the situation of the match and the win equation at the pertinent point of time.... B'desh (right from Tamin to Mahmadullah) tried to rush the issue and the results were disastrous... Experience pays at the end of the day boys and girls. Perhaps its time the Kids next door understand that.

Senseless, 2 off 3 is the best thing a team could hope for in any match yet Bangladesh somehow blew it away. This should be a wake up call. This will surely go down in history. Anyway, well done India and a great advertisement for T20s and cricket in general. A new rivalry is born.

Did anyone noticed a pattern here? India plays PAK in Kolkata where they already played BD before. They play BD in Banglore where BD played AUS before. Next they play AUS in Mohali and by the time AUS would have got experience of Mohali against PAK. So India is chasing venues already played on by their opponents. They are always at disadvantage and yet they survive. Next Australia play in Mohali a ground where PAK has already played NZ.

Haturasing is a good coach for exploiting weakness for opponents but he is not a good coach for picking right kind of players, i do not understand why BD is trying with mithun or shuvagoto, they experiment a lot  before world cup then took someone who was never tested.  Nair should be in their plan from the beginning, they should use nasir as a opener  , why Bijoy is not picked , is mithun is worthy then Bijoy who is a proven  performer, when Selectors will stop with shuvagoto, frankly speaking i can not see any positive body language from shuvagoto, that is the most important

No 10 ranked Bangladesh to it to India in their own backyard. Let's hope this is anothe turning point for Bangladesh. In ODI the catalyst was the PAK V bAN Asia cup Final and 3 years later they destroyed PAK, IND, SA in ODI series. The nerve tingling finish today should now give the impetus to BANs T20 aspiratIons.

HAHAHAHA!  India manages to steal victory from the jaws of defeat - from a minnow nation - a nation whose two self-proclaimed best bowlers cannot even bowl with a straight arm - by one solitary run - only because the other team screwed up in the last over, rather than by genuinely outplaying the other team - and now their fans are celebrating as if they won a World Cup or something!!  LOL!   Given the day's conditions and situations, any other nation in this tournament would have beaten Bangladesh comprehensively by 80+ runs, at least!  But yea, shine on, India, because this was, is, and will be your best performance in this tournament (and this year) by a considerable margin.  Congratulations, I guess...

It was an unforgettable lesson that Bangla team showed to all teams batting second. You have to keep it simple instead of going for glory shots. I wonder what was in the minds of Mushfiq and Riaz before playing those suicidal shots. Were they really nervous or wanted glory? Only they know for sure. Anyway they will regret for their lives for digging their own graves.

What does it say about them, that they are in the top league now, how well they played, how did they lose? India won, all players did well, who won it for them? DHONI - that stumping, that run out, that captaincy, what a player, what a CAPTAIN!!

Pandya is bieng unneccasry criticised by many.
He has nerves of steel and it was evident from his body language despite bieng hit for two bounadries that he beleived he could still win it.
He did that eventually..
In such close games its all about nerves which BD batters panivked while India did not.
Dont forget, Pandya was smashing around big and only a briliiant catch ended his inning else Indian score would be 160+ way beyond reach of BD.

Well played both sides. But Bangladesh could hv easily won this match if Mahmudalla and Mushfiqur used their brain in last 3 balls. There was no need to go for big shots in last 3 balls. just single could hv won match for Bangladesh. Hope they will realize it and correct it.

@COOL2COOL I read your comments and they're quite funny. Mushi exulted after hitting that horrible looking scoop for four and his exult was in the face of Pandya. Later Kohli's reaction towards BD dugout was the befitting reply to convey the message that you know who's the boss. Pak should play with associates as BD gives better fight then them.

For India to stay alive there cannot be scripted a tighter finish (apart from cm's rather than inches) .....been .watching in NZ....in a workplace with many Indians so it was very entertaining watching their reactions. NZ Blackcaps will be keen on the India v Aussie result now. If we get to the final we maybe playing one of you two.

@SAURAVJAIN : How much ever you wish Pandya to be replaced, He is here to stay. He may not become a Kallis or Sobers. But he is here to stay. Don't be surprised if he is in the Test match starting XI in 2 years time. He is a rough diamond which needs polishing. He is in good hands in IPL under Ponting's tutelage and under Dhoni/Kohli in International set-up. He will improve. No doubt about that.

After playing tons of international cricket, Mushy and Mahmudullah still couldn't pull off this win. Unfortunately, BD just has not learned how to cross a finish line in a close game. They always lose their head toward the end in a nail biter.  Mushy &amp; Mahmudullah -- couldn't you think before you act.

Heartbreaking for Bangladesh.  Reminds me of the India v Aus WC92 game when India needed 13 off the last over and Kiran More hit two 4s, leaving India 5 off 4, and still they lost by 1 run off the last ball.  Here Bangla failed to score off the last 3 balls needing only 2 to win.  Means NZ will likely top the group regardless of the outcome of remaining games.  The outcome of Pak v Aus and Aus v Ind now will determine second qualifier.

Bangladesh had to lose in spite of such a fantastic performance because they were too arrogant in terms of their attitude!

This match perfectly exemplifies what wonder it really does if a batsman gives a bowler, the respect where it's due. I still remember how Dhoni finished the match against Pakistan by picking up a single rather than going for a big shot!
</p>
<p>
Many frowned their eyebrows at it, especially those who've always perceived Dhoni as a big hitter. He is a big hitter beyond a shade of doubt, but added to it, he's an ideal finisher who has the incredible ability to adapt to any situation and play according to it.
</p>
<p>
This match has given us a couple of match winners: Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah. Coincidentally, both of them are 22 years old and are ideal future stars to represent India in future. The biggest lesson they would have learnt is that it's not over till the last run is scored. The sooner they implement this thought in their game, the better it would be for them. ;-)

Reason game got so close is due to India's poor catching and fielding. But in the end if BD had kept its cool, India would be staring at a meaningless last game against Aussies.

Compare the runs scored &amp; runs given by all teams in this WC so far...It says that all matches of India are played on bowling friendly pitches, but bowling is not their strength...still the players are doing fine with certain limitations (our bowling attack consists of two young inexperienced players, but they are punching above their weight)...especially Bumrah's last two overs conceded only 12 runs, who is performing faaaaaaar superior than experienced bowler...so if little batting friendly batting tracks provided, our batsmen could do fine...cricinfo experts also echoed this...

Few die hard fans said this morning that India will too strong to Bangladesh. In reality it was a miracle wiin for India  that shows how tough  Bangla boys are, as they were unlucky on key moments.
Questions to Dhoni:  
Why he is that thick ?Why he still back the non performers,  so called top three Rohit, Dhawan and Rain. Despiste 3 of them collectively scored today  against so called weaker team. Their consistent failures cost India another 20-30 runs on the board through out the tournament.
When spinners are doing great job, especially why Yuvi has not bowled a single ball in the tournament?
Why Raina bowled only one over?
Dhoni had no other option other than stuck to Pandey on the 20th over. Rest was really a miracle.
Dhoni must realize that if he wants to stick with the players whom he likes then in the next match Aussies will kick India out of the tournament .

@tjk1 That is a sensible comment. The best team from the universe is out, NZ is in semis and Ind/Pak/Aus can still make it to semis.

As a bangladeshi fan I've got to admire Jusprit Bhumra. What a bowler he has become! Just like Lasith Malinga and Umer Gooll in their prime time. If it wasn't for his penultimate over We would have won the game before the final over. Respect Fm BD. ........

How ironic that people still remembers Rohit's dropped catch against BD where he went on to make 60 more runs and helped India reach 166 on a 130 pitch even after a month. And India dropped 4 dollies just 3-4 hours ago and yet won the game, but nobody seems to remember those dropoed chances, eh? To all those who think AUS will roll over India easily, watch how convincingly you guys won against BD despite chasing. Had India been chasing today, they would have got whatever be t target witin 3 overs to spare and minimum 6 wickets in hand.

You 'tigers' made us proud.At the end of the day,it was a match between No.1 &amp; 10 - we don't play T20 much.We were right on top for 39.3 overs.And then the 'fate' called.Anywhere in the world,we're a 'top' T20 team after tonight.
[When did you see it last time that Indian players jumped on one another after they won a match?MOM Ashwin said,they played a T20 Match as 'tensed' as this one only once - 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final against Pakistan.]

What a captain, finisher- reads and judges the game and opponent's mind so well.
BD played so good, but were defeated by perseverance of Mr. Cool . My heart goes for BD fans, it just needed 2 singles in 3 balls. There was no need of big hit.
It will be interesting to see how team India goes from here, this may boost their confidence or they may look back and feel if they are really a contender for title.

Congrats to India for holding the nerves till the very last moment. Another hard-to-swallow defeat for Bangladesh, making the fans heart-broken. But they should now just pick up the pieces quietly and focus on next match to return home with one victory. The fans are sad, but the players must be devastated. One more time the captain will have to be the strong man and motivate the team. Hard job!

Coming from an SL fan : Dhoni's calmness is incomparable even to any of 
the calmest of captains this game has produced, like, steve waugh, viv richards, 
Hansie cronje, Ranatunga etc. 
</p>
<p>
The way he said 'Out' after that last ball without too much emotion or spice shows 
what this man is upto. Fans of other countries (including my fella SL fans) should
just admire and enjoy such games, learn the life lesson of composure of players like 
Dhoni, instead of claiming 'luck' etc. 
</p>
<p>
Finally almost everyone is forgetting the role played by Nehra in this game. He
mentored every bowler and also guided Dhoni all the way through and that is why 
Dhoni respects him so much. 
</p>
<p>
Now its either India or Australia who will win this world cup from here

Being a Pakistani I am saying that Today India was not lucky they snatched the match from the Bangladesh. Bangladesh lost because by those 2 stupid shots and there was not need to hit the ball, Good captaincy by Mr.Cool Dhoni and well bowled by Pandya. So India, Australia will be decided on 27th March. Pakistan is out and if Pakistan qualifies then its shame that the deserving winners in the pool are out. So best of luck to both Australia and India. Sorry Pakistan see you in 2020 in Australia.

@SMOOTHRASCAL...Losing or winning, Pandya &amp; Bumrah are very good recent finds for India...Its not easy to keep cool under tough circumstances in international cricket for youngsters who played very few matches (we have seen it yesterday in Khalid Latif's case)...Bumrah's yorkers are bowled with much accuracy than the pacemen of your team...today BD gave tough fight to India than your team which lost the match without giving any competition...Ind vs BD matches are taking much more importance these days...

Very  poor batting from India ,not clear favorites in this WC T20 very ordinary team needs to improve a lot in batting and fielding, But it was a great match ,What a match Dhoni!!!, you have proved your title "Captain Cool" once more( not lucky )with presence of mind (Take off one glove in last ball and run out ) Salute to you!!! MoM shud be given to Sir Jaddu for his 2 wickets,12 runs and  one super catch under pressure !!! BD fans your team will only get better from here. Back your boys &amp; be humble enough to respect every opposition,What a stupid choice of shot from Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah. They are too mature to play those glory shots.BD team and Fans will never learn from this silly mistakes.

This only proves how good Sri Lanka has been to win over India in the 2014 final &amp; the emotions Malinga , Sanga &amp; crowd have absorbed at the depth. BD projected itself very poorly reminding again  that they have not come a long way yet in having the grit, a full member team should have , still like an Associate member crumbling at the post in fear of winning.

I loved how Indian team was nerveless and took time to set everything right in the last over. The game was India to loose at the start, and they almost lost it with their fielding. Bangladesh played superbly to their potential, but they have to admit that they were the weaker side. Kudos to them and their captain who did everything right that they could. If not for those silly shots from Mushfiqur and Mahumudullah, they were home! I hope India learns from this and does better in their final game with Aus.

@PH_YOUNUS 'India is a very ordinary side that depends on the pitch' says who? A PAK fan? Do you forget how ruthlessly India thrashed you twice within a month already? You're no match for us mate. And secondly pitches in India may favour us but it didn't favoured us one bit in BD in Asia cup and yet we won it. If you're a BD fan which I hope you are not, then win a game against us and then talk. If you can't win despite being given 4 chances ( 2 Tamim, 1-1 Shakib-Sarkar each) then you need to still play with associates.

This match getting closer due to dhoni worst bowling changes. On the spining wicket, he dont want to give single over to yuvi?. pandya gone for 20 in his first two overs. if any one spinner bowled that over and taken a wicket then it will be easy match for india. but dhoni gave it up match by giving pandya overy every time when ever india coming back to the match. God only can save India...

Brilliant performance by Pandya, what a great comeback after being hit for 2 boundaries. The situation reminds me of 99 WC between Aus vs SA when SA required 9 runs Damien Fleming finished the game for Aus when he bowled 2 dot balls in the last over after being hit for 2 boundaries by Klusener. Pandya was brilliant with the bat too. For once Jadeja's BLIND HITTING fetched him 2 boundaries. lol.. Next game please play Negi orBhaji.

I'm extremely happy that India won today. I had said earlier that this was going to be challenging, but most comments said that this was going to be one-sided for India. In a way India is lucky that they played BD, because if this was any other side besides SL, Pandya's 4 out of 6 deliveries in the last over would have been dispatched out of the ground. So, yes, in a way luck was on India's side, but luck only favours the brave.

Yes happy that India won. snatched victory from jaws of defeat. Dhonis brilliant captaincy gave India victory. After this thrilling win, there are areas to improve before Australia game on sunday. If India play like today, we will be eliminated on sunday. So better Team practice hard to beat Australia and make use of this brain fade victory given by mushfiqur and mahmudullah.

For my fellow Indian supporters... You never know what's going to happen in a T20 match. So, stop debating over decision taken by a person who is leading the team for the past 9 years through so many ups and downs. Stop being a pseudo intellectuals and being judgemental  when you didn't  play any first class cricket in your life.

Would like to  invite Bangladesh to the official #THROWITAWAY party. 6 runs from three balls and a rookie bowling at the end. What was going through mamudullah and mushiqur heads? Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. That being said, I hope India takes a serious look at the glaring deficiencies in their team and jump off the favorites ship, they are not, they're underdogs now.The  Dhawan and Rohit combo clearly isn't working.   Bring in Rahane for one of them before the Australia match because that game too is an eliminator. I would also seriously reconsider Raina's place in the side. He scored thirty today but still looks like a liability to the team.

Bad luck BD and congratulations on getting out of jail India. BD deserved the win but went for the big shot once too often. Feel sorry for Masrafi and his team who out played India on the field and tactically. India was lucky to say the least. The umpiring standards at this T20 WC continue to be poor when it comes to LBWs. Dhawan was clearly out LBW in the third over (on 8 runs) but was not given out. He was eventually given out at the end of the sixth over (on 22 runs). The runs Dhawan scored between the third and sixth over alone (14 runs) would have been enough to win the game for BD. It only takes one poor decision to turn the game. Why not use DRS in T20? We use DRS in the ODI world cup and in test cricket. Is T20 somehow less important? I hope the T20 WC is not decided by umpiring error!

@VKumar086....Even BD dropped 2 catches. Al-Amin dropped a return catch of Kohli &amp; Hom dropped a difficult one off Raina apart from Shakib not going for the return catch from Rohit &amp; few other misfields from BD. So, both sides had their chances in the field &amp; the one who held its nerves in the end won it. I'd rather say BD choked with 3 wickets in 3 balls off 3 absolute rubbish balls in the end. MSD got lucky with the stumping of Sabbir when BD were cruising. Masrafe &amp; the BD coaching staff seem to know how to keep the star-studded Indian batting lineup honest. Definitely better than AUS, SA, WI, SL &amp; PAK in SC conditions. NZ are clear favorites to win this one ahead of India &amp; ENG

Al-Amin dropped a return catch of Kohli &amp; Hom dropped a difficult one off Raina apart from Shakib not going for the return catch from Rohit &amp; few other misfields from BD. So, both sides had their chances in the field &amp; the one who held its nerves in the end won it. I'd rather say BD choked with 3 wickets in 3 balls off 3 absolute rubbish balls in the end. MSD got lucky with the stumping of Sabbir when BD were cruising. Masrafe &amp; the BD coaching staff seem to know how to keep the star-studded Indian batting lineup honest. Definitely better than AUS, SA, WI, SL &amp; PAK in SC conditions. NZ are clear favorites to win this one ahead of India &amp; ENG

Bangladesh had no pressure throughout the game, they just lack the test knowledge and should have paced their innings better. They have done a west indies in this game, they are in the same league and the rest of the teams.

Breaking news !!! One of my relatives' neighbors in India had a mild heart attack watching this match. I wonder how many people in BD and IND had a similar health risk tonight. Jeez, what a game ! I cannot believe BD lost from that position. They must be heartbroken.

Well thing to remember is Bangla had nothing to loose and India were expected to win. And they played Australia earlier at the same ground.  The pressure was on India to win and they did it and that is what matters no matter how ugly their batting/fielding was.  Bangla had everything going for them, winning the toss.  Who knows, that bad loss in the first game against New Zealand may prove to be a blessing for India

What have you done BD? You had India by the throat and threw it away. India was never in the game. I dont know what it is with BD, they take their game to a different level when they play India. One thing is for sure, BD is here to stay among the big boys. I would want Afg to also join that. Respect from India.

Many people are claiming India didn't deserve to win or got lucky but on the other hand if India would have taken 4 drop catches (Tamim dropped by Nehra and Bumrah on 6 and 15, Shakib dropped by Ashwin on 8, Sarkar dropped by Dhoni at 5).This could had been a easy win for India but having said all that there are a lot of ifs and buts.End of the day Bangladesh can be proud of themselves how well they fought till the end I guess the the pressure got the better of them.They can take this as an experience and maybe they will pull off a win next time in these kind of crunch situations.

@AVINASH SINGH: How about all the risky singles that Raina took? If he hadn't taken those, then Dhoni's single would have meant nothing. So yeah, try and look at it as a team effort, and not as a one man show.

I think haters just don't want to remember or may be deliberately ignoring the fact that India lost the toss and still won which is just happening the second time in the tournament. Dropped 4 dollies on their worst day in the field and still won. Keep saying how lucky India is. If I start counting the umpiring blunders and toss which snatched away many India's victories it would be morning but the count will go on.

BD has just taken over the mantle of losing matches from certain victories - but I cant fin out from whom! whether from Pakistan, or from South Africa!! Only thing that was missing from Bangladesh team today was HEAD. They didnt have it when it was needed. And that includes not only the cool heads of Mushfiqur and Mahamadullah, also the hesitant runner Mustafizur off the last ball - anyone else would have started his sprint when the ball left the bowler's hand and would have reached half the pitch when the ball reached Dhoni's hands!

Heartwrenching defeat for BD . The nation is in mourning as l am. After playing for so long l had expected their maturity to carry them through after the brilliant fielding and bowling against India to contain them at the sub par score of less than 150.  So who is to blame? What happened. Maybe it was bad luck. But a few issues I'd like to share. Picking mithun when there are other experienced veterans was poor selection. Consistently sending Mahmudullah so low down the order made no sense. Mortaza coming in to bat before Mahmudullah made no sense other than to show his antics and penchant for hroics. Both Mahmudullah and mushy leaving the slogging till the last over was too little to late. And someone should've told mustafa to sprint to the other end to tie the score.  Don't know what others feel but these mistakes I feel  cost us the game of a lifetime.

Did India deserve to win? yes, starting from the fluke catch that took out Panda. the performance was poor, unlike India. I have this kind of knock when I play a poor player on a snooker table, you have to respect Bangladesh, they deserve it. You will not see a poor performance from India now on. The match they could have lost during the tournament end in the knockouts, they are already lost. the only way is up now!
India are rightfully the favourites with the best team they ever had. Yuvraj Singh, is my favourite, gifted with the timing skill I have never seen a player have. I have seen him in nets, he is gifted with something no one has. he has been criticised for not scoring enough in one final when he has singlehandedly won us the lot. I want to see this fighter score more than anything else.

@DELTA07, Aus is not licking their lips, they are sweating in their palms now that India will come hard at them. India had a bad day today and they should have lost but they didn't. So, now they can only play better with semis place still alive. If Aus don't win against Pak, they might be licking their wounds after another pre-semi exit from World T20.

Awesome game, Respect for BD from Indian fan.  If this is not a wake up call to our mighty batting line up then what else will?  Frankly BD winning would have made sure no Asian team in the last 4 of the World cup happening in SC.  It is good that BD lost and gave India another chance to enter Semi Final.  
India was well on the way of scoring 170+, if not for that one over that got both Pandiya and Raina out from Alamin.  That too me changed the course of the match and India ended up with less than 150.  If India put a total over 150 then BD have no chance at all, they have never won a match against a good team chasing a big total. 
</p>
<p>
Also Dhoni made a mistake of not playing Baji.  He said in toss that the pitch is tracy but ended up playing only 2 professional spinners. If Baji had played then India would have comfortably defended this total.  I am really not a big fan of Dhoni playing with same team. 
Knowing Mohali pitch that favors fast bowlers, Dhoni will again go with same team.

It is unfair to say India was lucky. When South Africa tied their run chase against Australia in the World Cup every one praised Australia for their perseverance. Why don't you say that India held their nerves in the last over and never gave up. It's not over until the last run is scored. Congratulations India, better luck to Bangladesh in the future games.

Brilliant game, enlivened by errors as well as superb play. Dhoni's swap of Dhawan and Jadeja at deep midwicket for Mahmudullah had as much to do with India's win as anything else; there's no way Shikar would have caught that one. Finally, Australia will feast on Pandya's offerings in Mohali, so a change to Bhajji is warranted if they are to progress to the semis.

@SAURAVJAIN, why you are hating Pandya so much? He is a good young prospect and doing good when ever he gets opportunity either with bat or ball, today he got out in a brilliant catch by Soumya , otherwise the score would have been 160.I agree with you Jadeja deserves MoM for his allround performance.If you think Jadeja will loss the place in the team because of Pandya , that is not going to happen.Both playes are good allround players , Indian need them badly
Infact Pandya bring balance to the Indian side and he is will be in the team for all the matches

Well played Bangladesh,, a massive respect from a hater of urs..  thank u dhoni for ur brilliance coz of which India Was able to escape from the jaws of defeat..massive respect to dhoni from his follower..

Yes, We won! The reality is that Bangladesh lost. My humble request to Dhoni: please play Bhajji in place of Pandya. All 3 pitches India has played on have turned square - Ashwin and Jadeja have enjoyed themselves. Look at Pandya's numbers on these turners - it's pathetic! Plus, playing spin has been a weakness for Australia! Look at how NZ is on the top as they have played quality spinners.

Hats off to you Bangladesh. But your players did the same mistake as misbah in 2007 T20 WC...
The nature of T20 is that you don't get much of a time to rectify your faults and Bangladesh committee those mistakes at crucial juncture of the match. India held their nerves just like Bangladesh and emerged as winners. Lady luck favours the brave. Accept this and no need to deject as you guys gave India a run for its milk...

@CLUELESSJAN1 Keep raving about who won and who lost, at the end of the day the table shows India at second position and BD at bottom. Point out a game where a team with average bowling defends 150 against 9 batsmen dropping 4 catches and still takes it to last over and win the match? Can you?
@FICTIONALISER I agree that this team is totally dependent on not 2 but 3 players, Dhoni, Kohli and Ashwin but point out any other team than NZ that has even 5 match winners in the side. AUS, SA? Oh please! Look at the way they lost against NZ and ENG. WI can reach SF but not final says my gut feeling.

Michael Vaughan said after the Edgbaston test of 2005 Ashes, the way Australia celebrated every English wicket told a story. For nearly 15 years prior, Australian teams would just turn up, and expect the English to roll over. Similarly, India's celebration and tension summed up Bangladesh's progress as a limited overs' team. India definitely dodged a bullet here. In many ways, Bangladesh bowled better, fielded better, and batted better until 19.3 overs. Gutted as BD might be, hope the scars aren't deep. As for India, props to Dhoni, Bumrah, and Jadeja for their coolth under pressure. But they'd know that they need to scale up a few rungs of performance if they want to beat Australia, let alone get to the semi-finals.

I guess it's a learning curve for Bangladesh. I have a feeling any Indian fan watching the mat glove will never again underestimate Bangladesh. All odds were against BD coming into this match but it shows what planning and disciplined bowling and batting can do. Pakistan had a similar experience with Bangladesh in the 2012 Asia Cup. IND needed to win big but failed to do so. IND were lucky and they knew it. Well done Bangla boys you have nothing to feel ashamed of .... this was a game for the ages and once again BAN had the sponsors, tv contracts, endorsement quivering in their boots!

India won purely because of luck here. Last 3 balls could have gone any where for a single but they went in fielder's hands. They do not deserve to win the tournament. its NZ who is consistent and deserve to win

ARUN.CRIC.FAN Any other side would have lost? Against Bangladesh? So, you're going to forget pressure bowlers like Southee, who restricted Australia to 11 in a final over to keep scores tied (with White and Clarke at the crease, both with half centuries), then restricted them to 6 in the super over to win the match?
</p>
<p>
Enjoy your team, even when they're struggling against minnows like Bangladesh, but don't then turn around and say any other team would have lost when just recently other teams have defended lower scores against better opposition. India put themselves in the position to lose then barely squeaked out of jail. Losing to a 'perennial underperformer' and struggling against a minnow shouldn't fill you with confidence.

BD players just like BD fans seem extremely emotional. They should have won the Asia cup a few years ago beating Pak and they should have won this game too. But while the talent has improved tremendously, they do not have the calm heads to see a close match through. Just look at Mushfiq and Mahmadullah's celebrations when 2 were required of 3 balls. You will never see someone like Dhoni celebrate prematurely. It ain't over until it is over.

But while the talent has improved tremendously, they do not have the calm heads to see a close match through. Just look at Mushfiq and Mahmadullah's celebrations when 2 were required of 3 balls. You will never see someone like Dhoni celebrate prematurely. It ain't over until it is over.

I would have liked to be a neutral fan in this match.......Cngrts to ind.....adrenalin got the better of mahmudullah,mushfiq......the two calmest duos in bd cricket lost the match for them

@SAI SHENOY - You say you are and Indian fan but your comments suggest otherwise. How can you say that if Taskin played Indian wouldnt have managed 146? Did you watch the Asia cup or were you sleeping when Indian thrashed Bangaldesh twice and both times Taskin was playing. So if you have to praise Bangladesh then at least talk some sense.

What a great game of cricket we witnessed today. A complete package and an incredible advert for the game. India put on a below par total on a bit of a challenging pitch. Bangladesh did exceptionally.well to restrict Indja to under 150. Indian batsmen never looked settled. Bangladesh fielded well and never let India to go to the next gear. 
</p>
<p>
Bangladesh innings experienced a similar fate. They never got going after a shaky start. There were moments of brilliance from Tamim, Sakib and Mahmudullah; however, it was the final.punch that of these batsmen missed. India's fielding was patchy which resulted in key reprives. In the end, it was Dhoni's magic that allowed India to win the match. It was Bnagladesh's match to lose after hitting 2 bohndries on the first two balls of the last over. And Bangladesh made sure, they did just that. They continued with their losing streak againy India in T20I. The biggest culprit was over ambitious shot selection of set batsmen to hog limelight- it failed!

I never thought this way one may lose !! If anyone want to lose without scoring 2 ran from 3 bolls with 4 wickets remaining, I think it's more difficult to lose but win...
By giving catch the leg-side boundary Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah both proved they don't want to win. It was a gift from Bng to Ind...

This win will do a world of good to this Indian team.
1. It will reinforce the belief that they can win from any situation
2. Bangladesh made full use of their knowledge of playing Australia in the same ground. They fielded brilliantly and bowled tight. They also won the toss.
3. The key moment , to me was the breath taking catch to dismiss Pandya. Had he stayed for 10 more balls, the match would have been all but over for BD
4. India had a rare bad day in the field. 
5. Hence even though BD planned superbly and executed them almost neatly (with luck seemingly on their side until last 3) to go over the line, there still is a big difference in class between the two sides.
6. The greatness of a side is reflected in their humility, which BD lacks. With all their improvement, I just hope they get rid of their stupid arrogance. It'll do a lot of good to them.

Be realistic in your opinions ppl.. This was not about captain  cool or a great final over bowling, it was just a miss from one team and a hit from he other. ndia never held its nerve.. BD lost it with poor shot selection and nerves. Nonetheless, a win is a win.

For once in his T20 career Jadeja got few runs today but I still think Pawan Negi would be a better option than Jadeja in the 11 bcoz his bowling is equal to jadeja but batting wise Negi is far superior big hitter..Brilliant performance from Pandya. His 15 off 7 balls under pressure &amp; his 2 wkts and a final dot ball was worth its weight in gold. He should open in place of Dhawan or bat higher to take advantage of the powerplays.For once in eternity Jadeja got few runs today but I still think Pawan Negi would be a better option than Jadeja in the 11 bcoz his bowling is equal to jadeja but batting wise Negi is far superior big hitter..

India won only because of one thing and that is LUCK! yes, that is called luck. No one with cricketing sense can believe is real thing what happened on last 3 balls. pandyia bowled a poor over but luck saved them. he bowled full toss it would have been easily singles on two full toss's But last blunder that no body notice was done by Mustafizuer Rehman. he ran very late they should have plan to run with bowler delivery which he did'nt. Dhoni ran him out by running you can imagin how much time Mustafiz gave to dhoni he collected the ball than ran than out! last 3 balls and massive silly cricket from BD. Both Mushi &amp; Muhamd was trying to be Hero to win a match with Six! now they got a lesson you can only become a hero after wining a match even a single would have make them hero. Any how good to see all 4 teams are still interested to get into Semi's

I guess I am one of those people who think India was lucky here. Okay okay... I didn't mean any offense. But trust me, had this been any other team, they would NEVER have lost this match. BD just proved immature towards the end. They blew it ! If this was say AUS or NZ or even PAK, they would have won on a canter. After it was only 2 runs in 3 balls. Come on, even India would jog for 2 runs and finish the game. But on the flip side, India held on to their nerve to defend 2 runs ! So I guess it's about perspectives. I think India are getting warmed up here. I am sure they now have found their hunger to keep winning games. T20 is a game of momentum and boy did India need this win to keep that going.

Actually India did not deserve to win although as Indian am relieved. BD had planned very well. They seem to focus so much on beating India. This intensity was lacking against aus and pak though. All this excitement would not have been possible had Rohit Sharma just waited to play out the last ball of the power play.  Indian batting is not good...the openers are struggling on Indian pitches. Raina is not doing good either. In the field India dropped catches and misfielded. Tamim was lucky and got away with rash shots. Tactically BD did very well and bowled beautifully. Similar to how SL planned in the 2014 WC final. But they need to do this with other teams too. For India this match was needed as bumrah, Pandya and even Nehra have not had any pressure so far . In fact recently India have not had a close finish. The match showed up Indias weaknesses and is a wake up call for them. Dhoni must be flexible and select rahane and shami so that opponents can't plan everything. But great game.

For me Jadeja is man of the match, he scored 12 crucial runs in 7 balls...took two  important wickets, saved loads of runs &amp; lastly, one brilliant catch under pressure by running from covers to mid wicket...one of the finest fielders in the world now...he answered today why he need to be there in the team...

India continuously playing on bowler friendly pitches since from Asia cup...when we will get little bit batting friendly tracks...today's Bangalore track was not like Bangalore track where we had seen loads of runs...I thought that at least today we get some batting practice for our batsmen, but disappointed very much..at the same time thoroughly enjoyed this THRILLER

What game of cricket we witnessed today. Indians proved they are much better team keeping their cool at crucial situations. No team would have win this one after pushed to defend 2 if 3 balls. It was India's game the moment ashwin got mithun. And they gave it back to bd by dropping tamim. Then they pulled it back by getting rid of shabbir and again gave it back to bd by dropping shakib at crucial time. Then its all over for India untill the final three balls of the match. Mahmud.. and mush.. should learn how to play sensible at that stage. It  requires just a little bit of common sense. Those shot they played will haunt them for a long time. Better players will come over it shortly. Once again a disappointment interview by BD captain not even have the courtesy to congratulate the opponents. For BD fans those giving respect to others will receive the same. If u plant weed dont expect apple.

India missed an opportunity to up their NRR. Now game vs. Australia is must win, because if India lose, their NRR will only go down. Pakistan beating Australia will put lots of pressure on Australia, and they play really well under pressure. Hoping for Pak to beat Australia, and Australia to beat India.

@Indocriclover's eye opener statement. "India is only second team in this tournament to win after losing the toss. Defending a paltry 147, against longest ever BD batting line up, dropping 4 catches and taking it to the last over. "

Dude - I'm not sure if you are being serious here or sarcastic. :). If you are serious, then I hate to say this but India is to blame for only getting 147, and they are to blame for dropping 4 catches! So, yes, India should consider herself very very lucky today. And this is coming from an India fan.

I cannot believe how people are asking for Pandya's head. He was on 15 off 6 and was accelerating brilliantly untill that superb catch from Soumya Sarkar. He fields brilliantly and took a superb catch of Mithun. And was bowling pretty well, it's the boundaries scored by edges that are making his figure look the way they do. If not for that cameo from Pandya, India would've scored in 130s and that certainly wouldn't have been enough.

Im an Indian fan and I feel BD should have won. Unless India pull themselves up and go on to win the cup, this win is of no use. Better it would have been to lose and have a shake-up in the team.  Pandya, Dhawan out Pandey and Shami in.

WHAT A MATCH !!! This was looking a lot like the Ind-SA match in WT20-2012 where SA kept hitting big shots and kept getting out but ultimately India won by 1 run &amp; here too India won by the same margin. I think I have never felt this kind of excitement and tension for years. I recall the Ind-Pak WT20 Final in 2007 which was a similar match. Another match I recall is the WC1999 Aus-SA SF where Aus looked out of it in the final over when Damien Martin was hit for 2 4s. Here too Pandya was hit for 2 successive 4s but ultimately kept his cool to help Ind win. A special mention of Jadeja for that terrific catch &amp; another special mention of Bumrah who initially ruined it for India by conceding a 4, dropping a catch, letting a 6 being hit and then going for 4 boundaries in his next over but then showed tenacity to bowl 2 lovely overs.. BD played very well but some poor shots have cost them this match. Ind wanted to improve their NRR but never mind. A win is a win.

What a game !! If anybody has a heart condition, then please refrain from viewing the remaining matches of this World T20 cause this is only the start. India got lucky I tell ya. BD will be devastated. I am an Indian fan but I feel sorry for BD.  India are almost there in the semis thanks to this humdinger. Now the whole of India should cheer for PAK to beat Australia in their final game of the tournament. AUS won't be easy push overs. If AUS do beat PAK, then that final league game between India and AUS becomes a virtual quarterfinal. Goodness, what a tournament we are having !

Bangladesh thought they could do a Dhoni to hit the winning runs. Dhoni will normally hit a 6 to finish of the game. It would take ages for Bangladesh to  reach that point. This is where commonsense  should be applied instead of emotion. All the people who were saying India was lucky. The field placement were superb in the last over, and the four hit by Mushfiqur is a fluke. India dropped 3 catches, 2 missed run outs, 4 misfields went to boundaries and Bangladesh fans talk about luck. Learn to respect the opposition guys or else you will be forced to hit the ground.

Seriously, India cannot beat Aus, NZ, WI, SA and Eng with this kind of batting and bowling.   Since Asia cup India lost 3 wickets early in almost every match. This is what happens when kohli fails with bat. Yuvraj singh can't stay at the crease for more than two overs. 
</p>
<p>
Funniest part of this game is that India had to plan just for one ball. They had no plans until then

India kept their nerves to win the match.Excellent captaincy by dhoni and bumrah,pandya bowling saved india from WC Exit.Bangladesh played very well through out this game and they deserved to win this match easily. Rahim and mahmudallah threw it away.India's Batting was very average surprising even kohli struggled on this pitch.3 dropped catches ensured bangladesh to breath easily and put pressure on india.Indian batting has had 3 wakeup calls until now.Its time batting fire on all cylinders when they take aussies on mohali.Curators are making life very hard for indian batsman and working to make india bow out of WC.Never saw such a ridiculous bangalore pitch.

@Very true Dharvesh KHAN,Pandya cannot bowl his 4,Yuvi/Raina bowls his rest left overs. This leads to both Pandya and Yuvi in Team.This leads to Mishra/Shami and Manish Pandey out of team.As simple as that. But why Dhawan is in team is most difficult and mysterious question?

I'm a diehard Indian fan but I cannot celebrate this victory. The way of some Indian players preformed today and the previous World T20 matches making me nervous about future games. BD was amazing and they deserve the victory. Indian selectors please drop Dhawan and bring Murali Vijay. Rehane is a good choice too but he doesn't have consistensy in opening where MV did well in IPL and agaist OZs as an opener.

What a stupid choice of shot from Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah. They are too mature to play those glory shots. This will go down in history, similar to the scoop shot from Misbah in 2007 Final. Mushfiqur and Mahmudullah will be regretting this for rest of their lives. Other than the last three freak balls, BD were truly on top. But cricket is all about who can hold their nerves better and India showed why they deserved a win. Pandya and Bumrah are a great find and will continue to rise. For next match, India will have to be far better than this. Specifically, bat better and field better. It may sound strange on a typical day, but their bowling won them this match.

With all due respect to Dhoni, I'm still convinced with this win. I know that its easy to be an armchair pundit, but what is the logic of not bowling spinners in the mid overs ? Against NZ on a rank turner, India played only 2 fulltime spinners. Even in the match against Pakistan, spinners bowled 8 overs for 36 runs and 2 wickets vs 10 overs for 77 runs off seamers. Again in today's match, Yuvraj didnt bowl, Raina got only over despite getting a wicket. Pandya got last over although went for 20+ runs off 2 overs. Its good to be creative, but not learning from mistakes is foolish. Hope MS trusts the spinners more against Australia.

As a Bangladeshi fan i can't give credit to India but only i can congratulate them for this victory. Credit goes to Mushy and Mahmudullah. It was their match to loose. In a way it is better for the tournament. As India is playing for Cup, this victory will boost them for the rest of the tournament. 
On the contrary this game will benefit BD team in future. Playing in-front of  big crowd in India against India is a huge experience for them. Because they play most of their games in home soil. I hope Icc will provide more opportunity to Teams like BD and Afg to play in foreign soil specially in India, Aus, Eng. Good luck to India for the rest of the tournament.

India did not deserve to win that game. Very similar to the WC 1999 Semi final. Bangladesh you have come a long way. Believe that you are already at the top level, and persist with this squad. It has to be one of the most balanced sides in Asia right now: with a great captain like Mash who leads from the front, the best spinning allrounder in the world in Shakib, really good fast bowlers in Mustafiz, Al amin and Taskin, one of the best fielders in Sowmya and one of the best finishers in Riyadh. Mushfiq and Tamim need to be a tad bit more consistent, but this team has the makings of a WC winning side, Imagine if Taskin would have played today, we would not have even managed 146. Our collective hearts go out to you, this is not the time to lose hope. You guys are a great team to watch! - From an Indian fan

That was as much luck a team could get and still BD lost. Winning the toss is a big plus on these dodgy wickets. 4 boundaries from Tamim were slogs/mishits and 3 boundaries from Shabbir were complete mishits where even he didnt know where the ball went. That's about 20% of the target in such a low scoring game. I am not counting on the dropped catches because normally I dont consider that as luck as fielding is a skill. Just like staying calm under pressure is a skill and India showed it today. Some more skill/planning - Dhoni removes his glove off the last ball anticipating the bye run, Dhoni swaps the fielders at deep midwicket at 19.5 despite Dhawan taking the catch and has his best fielder there, Dhoni brings on his best bowler at the right time to bowl out to pick up Shakib's wicket, Bumrah bowls 5 yorkers out of 6 balls of the 19th over, Pandya bowls a slower wide length ball anticipating the batsman's set up for yorker off the last ball. India won DESPITE not being lucky

I should start watching cricket as neutral, as whenever I support a team, they throw away an easy victory! Pakistan, Afghanistan, and now Bangladesh. Seriously, Mushy and Mahmudullah need to screw their heads on right. Had mushy played his shot along the ground, it would have been a match-winning shot as they would've ran two.

It was not luck that won the game for India, but it was the holding their nerves and once again the cool head of msd that sealed it.  I have written comments long back to remove msd from the squad when they were losing odis but man he is the best one that the team can have.  He is way smart, agile and sensible when it comes to stumping.  I don't think any other keeper in this world could have pulled off that stumping of sabbir rahman.  Bangladesh played well and were in control but no offence it was because of those dropped chances.  Tamim dropped on 10 odd runs and in next over he got 16 runs. Same goes with shakib too.  Luck was on bangladesh's side but the COOL HEAD "MSD"was on India's side.  He may have lost his midas touch but hasn't lost his cool &amp; thinking head.  He may be one of the greatest captains but he is the greatest of great keepers of the modern era and cannot be replaced by any one except him. Thank you and sorry MSD its time you lift the cup one last time.

This match is the biggest proof for all those last doubters that Dhoni indeed is a genius captain. Real genius. He has won some matches purely by his captaincy. WT20 Ind-Pak tied match where he asked Sreesanth to bowl short from round the wicket to Misbah, the WT20 Final where he used his best bowlers earlier to give Joginder a big enough cushion, and then going opposite to the prev tactic mysteriously holding back spinners asking Ishant to bowl the 17th over in ICC-CT 2013, his sudden self-promotion in WC2011 Final, and his brilliant captaincy + keeping today are signs of the genius of Dhoni. While we thought of Yorkers, Dhoni told Pandya not to bowl a Final Ball Yorker cos a Yorker would have been easy to hit for 1-2 runs to tie/win. He knew a bye would be tried and was ready. I think he was inside the BD batsmen mind. Awesome. And what do we say for the magical stumping of Shabbir? Dhoni's timing was perfect there. All hail the genius of Dhoni..

Its not luck that has caused BD loss and India win. Its the BD players lack of common sense and Indian players hanging around against odds that did that. BD played well, there is no doubt about that. But when emotions run high on your head you tend to make mistakes. What was needed is a calm head under pressure. Well the pressure was on India and not on BD in the last few overs. India held there nerves and BD lost it. This is what separates a good team from an average team. All is well that ends well. Its not necessary to win the match with a six when even few singles would have done the job.

I  believe BD didn't learn anything by seeing how Aussies tried to throw the match away against them towards the end..when 2 runs are needed from 3 balls batsmen just don't need to be a slogger..not evryone can finish off the game with a six the way our MSD does..

Bangla were playing like a team with nothing to lose as they literally had no chance to go to the semis. So that is why they wanted to spoil India's party. Just look at how all the batsmen except Mahmudullah were playing a shot a ball when it wasnt even required. Such teams are very dangerous and India did a really got job of coming out on top. Now for once can we  please have a batting pitch for India's match.

it's a alarm for Indian team about fielding, its below average. but again it's dhoni who is star specially sabbir stumping the turning point. he delays his hand to wait for feet to move.

It should never have gotten to the last ball. Remember the overthrows at the beginning of the innings? Really, it has become a sort of fashion to throw down the stumps without cause; it's happened at least 3 times in the last 4 matches.  It's going to cost India one day, just hope it doesn't cost a WC.

@DESIBOI80, Because Mr. Sanjay Manjrekar, the failed cricketer of his time, likes him. JADEJA and Pandya both made crucial contributions. But these two are always taken lightly. But without these two contribution India would have definitely lost today. JADEJA MOM for me.

Would be really surprised if MSD gets away without being fined for slow over-rates. India were about 25 minutes late in bowling their overs out. ~30% more time in an allotted 90 minutes time. No captain in the world gets would away with this

Phew! What a game that was. Credit to BD they fought well, bowled well but their batting should have pulled off this game. They will definetely be a force in the shorter version. Meanwhile I am really worried about this Indian team. The batting seems to be without any plan. Again Rohit needs to play into the gaps, if you have wickets you go berserk at the end. Will be surprised if this team win against the Aussies, leave aside the world cup. I was all for Dhawan and Raina, as they are really impact players and used to play without fear but currently they look all at sea. Again, I felt Dhoni should have bought Yuvraj on to bowl. If you are not going to bowl Yuvraj, then at least get Bhajji into the team. I credit Dhoni though for the brilliant presence of mind, a second to early or a second to late would nor have got him the stumping of the airborne Sabhir, unfortunately for the later. Good game.

Bangladesh is going to be a very decent team in the coming years, they are being looked at as a nation than a team, but they will soon shock everyone once they perform better in test matches. BD fans, show some patience, not envy towards team India, who are dragging a massive pressure of Indian fans, who are always deluded bu grandeur.  Bangladesh and newzealnd have clearly made the cricket gods bleed. This is going to be exciting now.

Harsh Truth: Since Pandya is incapable to bowl complete and decent 4 overs,so it leads to Yuvi and Raina to bowl his rest quota of overs. This leads to Pandya

During 2012 UCL semis,Barcelona had chance after chance to score couple of goals over both legs to knock out Chelsea in the semis and they didn't.During 2014 football WC last 16,Algeria had chance after chance to score couple of goals against Germany to knock them out,but Germany had to thank Neuer and Algeria's poor finishing as the game went onto extra time where Germany finally were able to put the game to bed.Today seems another day like this.Maybe I'm proven wrong but 2016 ICC WT20 means to be India's.They got no business staying in this ICC WT20,but they're somehow still alive thanks to their bowlers and their opposition losing composure in the key moment.

This match was like the theory of limits is calculus. Limit x tends to zero but never equal to zero, however small the difference between between x and zero may be. Limit BD approaches India but never equal to or greater than India, however small the run difference may be. Once again T20 is coin flipping.

Hello All, today it is not India won the match but Bangladesh lost the match. It might have been their lack of experience, choking or crunch situation what ever it is. India playing like this should not expect to win this world cup though they are keeping their aspirations alive. I'm not going to suggest that there needs to be a team change for them, the current team is very good but today their strongest pursuit 'fielding' has failed them a lot. Their fielding was worst I have seen for years (three dropped catches, misfielding etc). Their batting also let them down a bit today that score was not at all strong enough to defend and no batsman tried to stay and hit through. If they entertain any thoughts of going further and lift the cup they cannot play like this and expect miracles save them. Today purely a miracle and Bangladesh's inexperience in crunch situations saved the match. Kudos to Bangla tigers who woken up a nation with one jolt. Aussies must now be licking their lips.

what a presence of mind by dhoni! He knew that it would come to 1 run  irrespective of the bat hitting the ball. He removed one glove so that it would come handy if there was a run out chance. And what happened? batsmen ran a single for bye &amp; he sprinted about 15 yards &amp; effected the run out. i dont know whether that was possible if he had both gloves. his presence of mind only won the match for india

A lot of people asking someone to be dropped and it all being down to luck.Well,u make ur own luck.Cool head,Dhoni always looked more in command even 2 runs away from defeat.And what wud u do to d team balance by dropping Pandya?The third seam bowling option is needed,and Dhoni showed it today on a day when he had to use up his best bowlers.That again was a great tactical move,and left Pandya with at least 10 to defend.

@Sathish What fake all rounders? Jadeja should have been MOM in this game. Briiliant catch under pressure, crucial boundaries, plenty of runs saved by him, and wickets too at better economy than Ashwin. This is as good a all round performance as you will ever see. Pandya got 15 off 7 ball on a pitch where even kohli struggled to get going. Most of the boundaries on pandyas bowling were off edges. So what are you talking about.

Whoa, what a match it was! Commiserations BD, Congratulations India. That's the beauty of T20 cricket. A team chases 230 quiet comfortably and next match they're in trouble against a relatively inexperienced and weaker side. After posting 146 and a good start by BD, it was only Bangladesh's match to lose. But it's good teams like BD are rising up and giving these long time full sides a run for their money. There's always that element of slight luck that you need in this format and this time it was India's. However, BD can take positives from this game. Putting aside the suspension of their two bowlers, showed tough intent. Their finishers will henceforth not go for glamour hits when the match is easily on your palms. This surely has to go down as one of the most exciting matches and probably the best in this year's edition. Gotta give credit to the curators, there's been a vast variety of pitches offered. High scoring ones, turners, green decks.

If Yuvi is not going to bowl, get Pandey back in or even Rahane. Even when Yuvi scores his 20s it's at run a ball anyway, so Rahane/Pandey can't do worse. And Pandya may be today's hero but I dare say he needs to go before he loses a crucial game for India. His bowling is never good enough, so get Shami/Negi in depending on the conditions. Dhawan, Rohit, Kohli, Rahane/Pandey, Raina, Dhoni and Jadeja SHOULD be a strong enough batting order for India in T20s. PLEASE AT LEAST GET ONE OF THEM (Yuvi or Pandya) OUT OF THE TEAM.

India scored 59 and Bangladesh scored 79 runs in the first ten overs.  This is the real problem of India in this World Cup.  Remember England, South Africa, Australia scored well during powerplay overs.  Dhawan eats a lot of balls.  He is not consistent.  Today Kohli was not able to score well and that reflected in the final score that India scored.  India's fielding was pathetic initially with Nehra, Bhumrah and Ashwin dropping catches whereas Bangladesh was superb on the field.
</p>
<p>
India cannot expect to win with this attitude against Australia.  They will have to score briskly in the powerplay overs. 
</p>
<p>
Now it is between India, Pakistan and Australia to take the second spot for semi finals.  I reckon India has a better chance but if Pakistan wins against Australia and Australia wins against India, then India will not be able to make it because of the run rate.

@WASHIF AHMED Weather we deserve to be in the SF or not is a different matter, but let me tell you that your team PAK is the most average and now even BD will beat them everytime. Of alk the top 8 teams PAK is the one that doesn't deserve one bit to be semi finalists but the first to be knocked out. So my advice is that you worry about your own team.

What really happened to Dhoni on Yuvi? Why Yuvi had not given a chance yet to bowl in this series though the pitch seems to be good for spinning.Though Pandaya took wiket to win the match I believe in the last three matches,spinners(Yuvi,Ashwin,Jadu,Raina) would have preferred the most in the middle overs.Not sure what Dhoni has in his mind.Harbajan or Pawan Negi would have been given chance according to the condition.Good India Won the match.But India's last match against Aussies is crucial.It's a must win match if we lost then have to come out due to low run rate.I agree Dhoni is a Good Captain but at times he seems to be not at the best in terms of choosing or giving the chance to the players according to the condition.Well done India.Best of Luck to the next match to keep the series alive.

Why India is lucky...BD is lucky because generally the electric fielding side (India) dropped 3 catches...if not India would have won by 30 runs margin...When Tamim was dropped he scored 14 runs (went on to score 35), after the drop catch of Shakib, he scored 14 runs more...Soumya also scored 8 runs more after his drop catch...anyhow Im not satisfied with this win, want some changes in the team...Negi/Harbhajan should come in Yuvi's place, Pandya is ok with his fielding &amp; batting...Dhawan's form also worrying, may be Rahane is good bet (but its already too late to make any changes)...Ashwin nailed it correctly, today we did not play with the top contenders...all teams except NZ &amp; WI are struggling here, this is making T20 WC 2016 as more thrilling...

Luck favored both the sides- India  dropped 3 catches- 2 of them dollies; while Bangladesh tried to do a Dhoni in the last over- winning with a six. They learnt today that winning with a six is not everyone's cup of tea.

Again it's MSD again who won the match. That shabbirs wicket was sheer class from a WK &amp; yes Pandya over was master class from the man himself who has done with joginder sharma. I thought Pandya deserved the MOM there . For his catch off Mitun &amp; and that super last over !!!

Pandya despite being on a hat trick played for the team and for the nation, selfless from him.

Terrible performance by India ... somehow still alive in tournament because of Bangladesh's substandard performance. Seriously the most over rated bunch of players in this tournament... only Dhoni and Kohli are cut above the rest and Dhoni is gonna retire any moment ..

Wow.. what a game (once again didn't watch it &amp; don't feel missed anything either). Bad luck BD, better luck next time. India really doesn't deserve to be in semis .. for their performance so far in the tournament. Catches win matches - India failed, batsmen get you decent scores - India failed, bowlers bowl out opposition - India failed. Only luck got them through alive in the series. If Aus manage to win against Pak, it would be Aus v India Quarter Final. If Aus loses to Pak &amp; India loses to Aus, India would be knocked out due to NRR, either Aus or Pak will go through - mostly Pak unless, India crash against Aus. (Indian fan) @Maneesha Gamage: Care to remind me how was Sachin dismissed in 1996 WC Semis ? Was that a normal delivery from Sanath ? Think twice before posting one, coming from a team who bowls only wide yorkers near the popping line - Chameera did the same against Windies as well, bowl wides to stop opposition's 100  &amp; you're out here to give moral lessons to others

Match awareness - during India inning on the last ball Dhoni took 2 runs.  If they had thrown to Ashwin's side he would have been out.  That one run is the difference. Just saying. To all the India haters, pls don't waste your breath...

Bangladesh literally gifted the match to India.India deserved to lose and after 3 league games,the hosts simply don't deserve to win this T20 WC.Favorites when the tournament started,India's batting touted for its so called might has been an abject failure and a big let down with Kohli as one man army reminding fans of a similar Tendulkar era in the '90s. Dhoni's decision to run out Mustafizur and choosing not to throw at the striker's end was a critical one and deserves accolades for backing himself against the opponent and kudos to MSD's fitness and reflexes that also caused the Sabbir stumping. But he continues to back non-performers and stubbornly refuses to ring in changes in the Indian playing XI. The list of non-performers -Dhawan,Rohit,Raina and Pandya is quite long and no player (Raina,Pandya etc) should ideally be in the XI purely on the strength of their fielding prowess. Prime reason for fans like me openly disliking MSD as India's shorter format captain.

Feeling sad for BD. But, what were you thinking? Looked like the SA-Aus semi-final of 1999 World Cup. For us, with this kind of batting, India getting knocked out is around the corner. 3 matches, they just need to come out on the winning side for just 3 matches more. Easier said than done.

@COOLCAPRICORN Why support him?For the cause of cup?What wrong with you ? Do you expect Shami or Mishra that they have given 30 runs in 3 overs in every game. Mishra,Shami and even Bhajji should play for Pandya. I don't think you are Indian Supporter. India won out of luck today only. Pandya has almost perished the world cup. Not only me but all the comments below of various guys are opposing Pandya. Only 42 runs are given by our leading spinners in 8 overs. Spinners have bowled exceptionally in all the wc matches . Then why Mishra or Bhajji is waiting. And if a blind hitter is required than Axar Patel is better choice than Pandya. Atleast Axar would complete his 4 overs for around 30 runs (and not 40 runs unlike Pandya).

You men in Blue, you idiots have almost caused me a heart attack. Just kidding. Well played team BD, you executed your plans to perfection (almost), and at least you won this Indian fan's heart.
Team India - more than a billion hearts are behind you don't forget that. Scoring a paltry 146 on a a flat-as-a-road Bangalore pitch is not stuff of a contender. Something is seriously wrong with the planning and execution. There is still time to rectify and improve. All you need now is win 3 games in a row by hook or crook. Go Men in Blue. Make us proud.

actually pitch played a  vital role,, Bangladesh did well to restrict india to 146 which s a avg score but it was india who finished well particularly dhoni,, he is the true champ.. Bangladesh should have got out somewhere around 115 to 130  but they had luck going their way by couple of easy catches put down n more mis fieldings... indeed Bangladesh team is far far better team than Australia, Pakistan, srilanka, England...

It could have been Bangladesh ; Knocking India out of Wt20 2016!! 23rd March!
Well played Bangladesh!! I am an Indian... And you guys just earned a fan!! 
As far as India goes, with their dismal display of cricket in this tournament ; It seems they wont even reach semi-finals! Though I want them to lift the cup!

India's batting is on sleeping pills. Hope the force awakens. Raina, Dhawan need to fire not just score those timid tuk tuks. Yuvraj is neither here nor there. Dhoni must focus on timing his shots not just swing like in nets.

Wonderful match won by India. Kudos to BD for giving us such a fight. Awesome fielding by yuvraj, sir Ravindra Jadeja. Saved a lot of runs. Bumrah, the way he came back after two wayward overs was awesome. Credit to Pandya as well, maybe he just got lucky after bowling those full tosses. India again proves its supremacy in the shortest format. Rooting for an Ind vs Sa semi-final and IND Vs WI final. Cheers!

Anyone praising pandya for the last over knows nothing about cricket. He bowled absolutely poorly but got away with it due to some shocking batting. Bumrah is the real match winner at 17 from 12 balngladesh were favourites but he only conceded 6 runs bowling really good balls

I don't understand why some Indian fans are so disgraceful in this victory. And what's with the attitude against BD team and fans in general? As an Indian fan, I am enthralled with this victory, but have to hand it to Bangladesh for the way they played. Mahmadullah's shot was a gamble and it could have been a six, and as luck would have it, it wasn't. India just got lucky to win this game. So it is BS if you say that India held their nerve better. 
</p>
<p>
BD, one day you will and you should win a major tournament. You are slowly and steadily earning respect. Don't be disheartened. It has been a great tournament for you so far, despite the losses.

India needs to improve their batting..it's time up for Yuvi to go out for making way to rahane.

People are saying India is lucky, really? Here is an eye opener for all, India is only second team in this tournament to win after losing the toss. Defending a paltry 147, against longest ever BD batting line up, dropping 4 catches and taking it to the last over. If there was any team deserverd to win it was India.

Oh man now we have to read complacent comments from BD fans. Can someone explain why BD is unlucky and India is lucky? 1. BD won the toss and got bowling favorable. 2. India have been in lowest form today with so many loose shots and catch drops including super fast Dhoni. Who is lucky in the end? It is very clear India should have won the match easily but not sure what made BD fans to dream about luck factor now. Can you please learn to make some mature talk?

What a ripper of a game.. If you are an Indian fan you can afford to smile for now but lot of work needs to be done if we gonna beat Australia or any other teams for that matter. Dhawan needs to be replaced by rahane and Shami for Nehra although the 2nd one looks unlikely

I feel extremely sad for Mashrafe. Every move he made today was simply perfect. India were under pressure throughout the match; and it showed both in their batting and fielding. But ultimately the classic losers have snatched defeat from the jaws of a win. Tamim, Mithun, Sabbir, Shakib all of them threw their wicket away; otherwise Bangladesh could have chased it down within 18 overs. And Mushfiq, once again showed that he is able to lose any match from any situation.

Upset for BD, the team, the Captain and the fans.
It was ours to lose and we lost it. Losing doesn't really hurt as does the way BD manages to lose these games.

Pressure got the best of BD, and the Indian skipper cool and calm took the match. Good work India under pressure.

<p>
In matches like this, it's the 1s and 2s that does it, but India were lucky playing BD, because they simply naturally go for big shots and offer wickets. Fatal flaw from day 1.

India should rethink their selection after today. Replace someone with manish pandey by some reason(whatever it is) bring him into the squad and replace him with either pandya or dhawan. We need at least one relible player as the opener. Rahane is not reliable he also failed in every chance he got, we need someone outside the box here.

well the last 5 overs i thought India has lost the game ....... Most of us are saying is dhonis luck helped india but just imagine when dhoni faced the last ball and got 2 runs, if that didnt happened india is gone!! also the Indians dropped and missed a lots of catches and chances. But in the end i will just say well played both teams specially for BD

@SMOOTHRASCAL: "so nw evryone knows cricket s lucky game not talented one". Depends. If you are a BD player/fan, it seems cricket is a unlucky game :-). Peace brother, try to appreciate the finer things in the game.....like staying calm under pressure, having the grit to not give up until the last minute, etc.

Bangladesh miss the plot,after the blower done gr8 job to restrict India below 160 . I think Dhoni should drop Dhawan and bring Raina, I think dhoni being luck these time but he should play Harbhajan or neigi instead of Pandya. I think dhoni should learn tactics from willamson he drop their best blower Boult and southe and playing three quality spinner.

ClueLess..Yes BD played well , than what about AFG  they just pushed Eng,Sa to the does it mean both Sa,Eng are ave. Teams these minnows have nothing to lose, the score line Bd lost all matches , we need not read too much on this result.

Luck Heavily favored BD till 39.5 overs. 3 dropped catches (Dhoni, Nehra and Bumrah). First ball boundry misfield by Pandya. Cheeky boundries by BDs and terrific catch by Soumya and couple of misfields by india. Not to mention missed 2 close missed runouts of BD. and top that with 2 to win/1 to super over in last 3 balls. 
If not today when else BD is going to win? lady luck was all all all the way with BD and still they lost. That actually hurts most.

Bangladesh u won our hearts. India dont deserve to qualify. They are heavily dependent on kholi and ashwin. Bangladesh team seems to have a more bright future then pakistan ahead of them.So the 2nd spot is still up for the grab between india,australia and pakistan. Seeing these 3 teams performance neither deserves to be in the Sfs

Take heart Bangladesh. You made India hurt, sweat, struggle and toil for victory. They didn't celebrate like this even for winning Asia cup. Also, not everyone is a Dhoni, what was the need to do slog shots *twice* when all you needed was 2 runs in 3 balls. Both of them would've been heroes even if they won by taking 2 singles. 
</p>
<p>
But, Bangladesh is a rising force, its reminiscent of India in the 90s and early 2000s. They had super stars but didn't know how to win, keep up the fight friends - gold &amp; glory is nearer.

Say what you want about MS Dhoni. I didn't like the way he's favored Pandya over Yuvi/Raina's bowling either. But has there ever been an ice cold cricketer than him? I haven't seen one in all these years of watching cricket. That stumping of Shabbir. How the heck does he pick exactly that fraction of a second to break the stumps! I can't think of a single ex-Indian captain (Ganguly comes close) who could have got that level of cricket out of the whole team in those last few overs of this match.

Dropped catches had put Bangladesh on the course but Dhoni's presence too intimidating, even behind the wicket. Bangladesh was lucky to reach this far because of dropped catches.

They called themselves as favourites of the tournament and still not into the semis after 3 games. A defeat against New Zealand,  close game with Bengal tigers and now depending on Aussies to get through. Ha ha. Way to go India.

And thus BD are still minnows... and pathetic as usual. Musfqar, mahmudullah come of guys u r BD players, u r not MSDhoni or JavedMiandad. Trying to finish by hitting six??? huh... silly guys.... A team overrated by their fans.. nothing else... today Mustafizur got some hammering tooo... and yes his secrets are getting unlocked.
</p>
<p>
And India plz.. improve ur fielding... if u had taken the chances of Tamim and Sakib.. this BD wouldn't have crossed 100 in this pitch.. at least India could have finish this match with good runrate.

Dhoni, pls place bring Pawan Negi to 11...He is too good spinner compared to Raina/Yuvi...Aswin/Jadeja/Negi can do the job for you..Pandya is giving too much runs...can stop experimenting with Raina...I think Yuvi or Pandya can be replaced..pls show some braveness in team selection in next match..pls....

Besides batting and bowling, running between the wickets, fielding, general fitness and agility, presence of mind and remain focussed under pressure are also important to win a game. Dhoni's men used them to score a win and earn 2 points. Some less than ordinary people calling it luck demonstrate their incomplete knowledge of the game. BD played very well but lost on the last ball. Good match in the end and Congratulations India.

Before this match, I thought India would win other games very easily. Now it looks like India does not worth the semi final spot. Let the better team win for the Aus Vs Ind match.

The win separates the men from the boys from a temperament perspective.  Even with three crucial dropped catches, BD couldn't win.  Two runs in three balls with good batsman in the crease, what more do you want?  If you cannot close deals from here, you never can!  This one is going to hurt.  This will also hurt for a while and I don't see BD having the leadership to bounce back quickly.  It will be a slow crawl.  Shame, because they have so much talent!

The team which made the less costly mistakes won the match. India obviously made more mistakes and Bangladesh were cruising until the end. But when it really mattered most Bangladesh made some biggest blunders and that cost them the match.

This is the difference between Bangladesh and other top teams. Bangladesh should have won it hands down but no! Rahim was celebrating like he had hit the winning run. 2 needed and they are playing aerial shots. India were poor with their batting and fielding. But when the pressure was up, they stood up and Bangladesh crumble.

Jadeja at deep backward point for Mahmudullah for the first ball. Mahmudullah hits it straight to him first ball. MahmudUllah takes a single nd goes off strike. Mahmudullah comes on strike on the 4th ball. Jadeja goes to deep midwicket. Mahmudullah hits a full toss straight to him. Coincidence?? Really??

The Bangladeshis made a bad decision in the last 3 balls of the match, quick singles would have won them the game. Pandya was lucky if you ask me. The amount of mistakes India made in this game any other side would have capitalized. I feel really bad for the Bangladeshi team but at the same time I think the Indian team has been very lucky in this tournament so far. I don't think them favorites at all but do think they will make it to the semis

Congrats India albeit escaped literally by the skin of their teeth to survive in the WC. Pandya was lucky in the 20th over to take 2 wkts + a run out off the last 3 balls - with just I run to tie &amp; 2 runs to win by BD. Never has the luck been so tilted &amp; India has to thank Dame Luck for this Win. A Tie or loss would have eliminated India. Now if India beat Australia in their final match they will qualify. Indian batting was doleful + only 2 bowlers Ashwin &amp; Jadeja bowled to their potential. Bumrah, Nehra &amp; Pandya leaked runs freely. On the whole it was a pathetically poor show vs. a BD team that got blown out by other 3 teams in Gr. B. Indian batting is highly vulnerable against good bowling &amp; their weakness was exposed even by BD. Will Dhoni get a batsman instead of inept Raina / Yuvraj? Dhawan &amp; Rohit are already "Iffy". That leaves a solo bat in Kohli. Playing the same XI irrespective of its short comings &amp; keeping Rahane &amp; Shami on bench has &amp; will hurt India badly!

What were Bangladesh thinking?They did all the hard work yet brought the match close by some senseless moments in the middle and then  when it was almost done and dusted they just decided to lose.Whats going on??

Indian team looks very average. Its taking a lot of luck for them to remain in the competition. Also , why are the good pitches suddenly turning into slow turners each time India plays? Isint the pitch supposed to be under ICC and not BCCI?

Let's not think about who is favourite to win the cup or who is not. Reality is, calling your team favourite only gives false hopes.India,SA, Aus, NZ or any other team can be deemed favourites by all the experts here but the winner will only be the team that performs consistently and more importantly on the all important day.So till then please enjoy matches like these and stop being over analytical.

I do not think India won here. Bangladesh clearly lost.. 2 runs from 3 balls.... who cannot win from this situation? Could have just taken singles. Why loft the ball in this situation? Hard to understand. BTW, I am an Indian. Perform like this and prepare for a lose to Australia. Wanted a upset today.

Holy cow.  What a match.  Please all the Indian haters dont come out and go blah blah.   Bang is a good team and beaten quite a few top teams for India to do what they did in the last 3 balls was great.

Mudit, 
Dhoni is not lucky. he planned last ball. In my opinion, who is luck-- Yuvraj Singh. I've no idea why he is still in the team tho. You really have to see how he plays.

@RUCHIT KHUSHU Don't poke your nose. Arent you seeing what he is doing? Going for 30 runs in every game. Scoring few runs only against weaker bowling and spin full-tosses. Not even completing his 4 decent overs. Tell me now why Amit Mishra is kept out in such wickets when even ordinary Ish Sodhi is peaking. Why Dhawan,why Yuvi. Why not Rahane,Mishra,Manish Pandey. It's not boring. You want something new then cheer for Oman a new team. New players does not mean you just kick Amit Mishra,Axar Patel,Shami.

Well played Bangladesh. Its not India win Bangladesh. Bangladesh lost a easy match. So far in the tournament India hasnt displayed batting strength. Openers failed to perform so far. Aussies- India quarters will be a true test for battinng strength

That was the most naive cricket from Bangladesh. After hitting those two boundaries, all they needed were singles to win the match. Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur threw their wickets away needlessly and costed their team the game.

@ MICHAELBURTON Its the media (that too non Indian authors) who 'proclaimed' that India is favorites.
Funny how BD fans talk about luck going our way but conveniently ignore all the luck going their way. Wasn't Tamim riding on all his luck all the way ? and the so called lucky wicket (no credit to Dhoni right?) had a lucky  slog fest till then.

India won the match but they are not good enough. They were in lowest form today. Really tensed match. Worst in this match was 1. Indians dropped so many catches in just 20 overs. 2. Dhoni playing dot balls in final overs (worst I have seen in this WC). Best in this match was 1. Bangladesh bowling. Indians should have closed the match early with better fielding. Bangladesh got so many chances and they still struggled to defend the total.

So from my understanding. West Indies and New Zealand are the two teams to beat. All the other teams (India Australia England SA)dont look remotely confident in these conditions. India got to bat first and definitely shouldve posted 160+. A valiant fightback by Bangladesh but unfortunately it wasnt enough. Bad signs for India. Hopefully we show India the right way to beat Bangladesh. A one run victory means nothing.

Ravindra JADEJA must be the man of match for that crucial difficult catch in last over,two imp wickets at decent economy,and quick runs from bat. Now Dhoni Pls call Amit MISHRA,MANISH PANDEY,RAHANE AND SHAMI. Drop Pls Hardik PANDYA,Yuvi,Dhawan.

Guys, I'm an Indian fan and agree that we batted horribly - we were at least 25-30 runs short. That said, we have to appreciate the late fight-back from our bowlers. I for one, didn't think we had a chance, but fortunately, I was proved wrong:). India has started badly, still trying to find their legs, but I think they'll peak when it matters!

What a gut wrenching loss for us.  2 needed of 3 balls and we lost our head.  Congrats to IN for the win and keeping cool under pressure but this loss is on Mahmudullah and Mushy.  2 singles needed and we went for the slog.  Lost three wickets in three balls.  Terrible!  I am happy though that it was a closely contested match.

I'm an Indian fan, but my heart goes out to Bangladesh for the way they played today. They came in as the underdogs and played like true champions. Honestly, the match could have gone either ways, and India should consider ourselves lucky that we prevailed in the last over. If India doesnt raise their game by leaps and bounds, we will be knocked out sooner or later. Congratulations India, and for the Bangladesh team, you guys really rock!

Guys i think everybody needs to relax , no need to curse each other and i would say that though bangladesh lost they gave a good fight to the tournament favorites and they are really doing good as a team they just lack the killer instinct ..   ie. Mahmudullah a nd mushfiqur shots werent needed. Tough luck.
Good game of cricket.

Wow. What an ending. This has been the best game of the tournament so far. Bumrah lost it for sometime today - I hope he does better next match. Dhoni - I dont know what to say. This man, in the shorter formats, is super intelligent. That Sabbir stumping was just pure timing. Dhoni waited and waited till Sabbir's feet just left the crease. Awesome stuff. And then taking his keeping gloves off before the last ball was pure awareness. And then the 15 yard sprint to break the stumps leaving nothing to chance ( and not doing a jonty style dive ). These are the days when other teams will wish for a player like Dhoni in their side.

Feeling bad about Bangladesh. But it's only them and their lack of maturity that is to be blamed. When 2 runs were needed to be scored off 3 balls for a win, they should have gone for a single first to ensure a tie and then think of slogging. Hotheadedness doesn't help. Hope these words will reach some of the BD players involved.

Despite good effort Bangladesh still remains the same. If India wins this cup they owe this to Bangladesh stupidity. How come a side lost the game when they have only 1 run to tie. I have never seen such stupidity. Maybe the Allan Donald run out against Australia in the 1999 world cup come close. But what luck India is having.

That was total brain freeze from Bangladesh in the end. Never seen something like that in a T20I in a long time. Why go for slogs when you can just need to get two singles to win the match? India didn't win today, but Bangladesh surely gifted the victory to them!

Wow! This was something. India won, but it was Bangladesh's game to lose, and boy did they choke! The game was riddled with mistakes from both the sides, but in the end, we, the people, got to watch a cracking game of cricket, and India is still alive in this tournament!

As well as Bangladesh played they have lost their 3rd match in a row now. As poor as India has played they have now won 2 out of 3.. Often such close contests get a team really together and going !! Great job India somehow :-)

Bangladesh are absolutely shocking for not chasing down this total taking it so close. 2 of 2 balls with a shocking bowler bowling. If you can't make that then surely they should be demoted to an associate

@SAURAVJAIN: Well that's all good when you've runs on board. With a paltry total like this to defend, the only thing you can do is use your best possible options and put pressure on the opposition early on. Just can't let the opposition top order to get control with such freebies. That's where I believe Dhoni lost it today.

Whatever the result maybe, It has been a great match.Cricket has absolutely been the winner.Great death bowling, calculated batting and partnerships.This game has everything in it.Probably the best match in the WT20 as scales were tilting every over.

@SANJAY NAIDU Why Pandya is even in Squad ? Merely because of few blind hits in IPL(like great Yusuf Pathan). Amit Mishra,Manish Pandey,Bhajji,Shami all are out due to luck based blind hitter Hardik PANDYA.

With Pandya any captain would worry to complete fifth bowler overs @ADI133. pandya has almost perished India. I am demanding Amit Mishra/Shami, Rahane and Manish Pandey for SL series. But Pandya,Dhawan and Yuvi have performed too ordinarily and cost us the world cup almost.

That's poor from MS. With a relatively low score to defend, you need to attack from the word go. It seems as if he's looking to finish off his options. He should have bought Jadeja earlier there. No point finishing 5th bowlers' overs too early.

I think the match is still level though tilting slightly in India's favor. With all the opportunities given by India they really don't deserve to win. The Indian team needs to mount the pressure now by bowling dots and forcing the Bangladeshi batsman to play erratic shots.

Mr.Dhoni lately what has happened to you. Are you worried about your captaincy or worried about retirement.The Bowling changes and bowlers you are using these days in WC are quite baffling to watch.When you have spinners at your disposal why do you want to use Pandya who is easy hit on this pitch.When your team plays you batsmen make us see demons in the pitch , but its other way around when opposition Bats.Have you lost it, if so plz leave, don't stick around as captain,play as a WK . If not get your acts correct &amp; do well to qualify.Also pick extra spinner, it wouldnt hurt you if you drop dhawan ,he is doing no good anyways, both with bat &amp; fielding. from a distraught ind fan.

So, Rahane was dropped with the reason 'he needs pace in the wicket otherwise he finds it diffucult to score with good SR' . So, question , which indian batsman is playing well and scoring at good SR consistently on slow pitches??? May be VK, rest all are failing when there is no pace in the pitch. Look at Rohit and Dhawan, esp the later one. Dhoni has singled out rahane , for no fault of his and simply overlooking at others. Compare the SR of Rahane with others when the pitch plays good. When the pitch doesnt play good, Rahane is much much better than the current team batsmen !

Tamim Iqbal Khan in the house. This one will go BD's way. Then, the bigmouth fans are gonna go berserk about how BD is going to make the semis and possibly win the WT20. That's when NZ will completely thump BD in the last league fixture. Actually, though I'm an Indian bloke, I don't mind Ind losing. This should make them reconsider dishing out slow, spinning pitches. After all, Ind ain't the only team that can tackle spin, and spin is no rocket science. Imo, for global events ICC should depute a team of neutral curators so that WCs don't turn into jokes like this one, with either rank turners or flat roads on offer. Disgrace, BCCI.

Bumrah drops a catch, comes on to ball a few balls later and goes for 16 off the same batsmen. That's gotta hurt him.

NZ and WI are not favourites. They look to be peaking to early. You want to play your best in the knockouts and win the group games with some struggle, in like 3rd gear. You only play your best in the semis and finals.

Very  shameful batting by the Indian team and very disciplined bowling by the Bangladesh, kudos to them for handling the tension very calmly, because now a days India VS BD is becoming as like India VS PAK. But India is already out of the series so no worries. Atleast in next WT20 we would be good, our team will have young kids to perform and oldies like Dhoni, Yuvraj, Nehra will be out and Raina, Rohit and Dhawan should be sacked, Pandya will be improved by that time, Iyer and yadav should be brought in. Cheer up guys and leave tension, get ready for IPL heheheh

Bangladesh bowling in this match and NZ bowling shows that you don't have to be world class tearaway fast bowler or great spinner to succeed in T20 format. You just needs to be discipline and smart to restrict a good batting side like India. This smart bowling have given Bangladesh a good chance to win this match though still I think India can defend it. Good Luck to both!

Bangladesh needs to bat sensibly here. they are playing against the Home Team and they are very good in spin. India showed good spin bowling in its last matches which was unplayable to its opponents. Bowling and fielding was good especially holding a long and strong batting line ups like the Indian's at bay. But it's not the end until they finish the match in their favour. The good match temperament will all be in vain if they cant have the last laugh.......fingers crossed boys.

To bangla fans: I read all comments here, most of you are just talking trash. Game isnt over yet, its a tough pitch. Dont you guys get tired of talking smack and winning nothing? i mean what if Ban wins today? they still go home. They have never won anything meaningful, only caused upsets. Did bangladesh even buy a trophy closet? or they still keep delaying it? Show some respect for the game. how can one keep talking smack for 15 years with nothing to back it up? I recon another 15 years before they are given an entry to start wcup with big boys. Good luck if you think you are going to win. A  for captaincy this game to bangadesh, A  fielding and A for bowling. Batting will not be easy...cant wait to see the look on these "fans" faces. No respect for bangladesh.

This Performance has made this group very interesting. If they win (which I think will need them to play to the best of their abilities) will make it possible for all the four teams to make a spot in the semis. Let's see. Bangladesh need to start well. Indian bowlers need to respond today. Good match.

Great bowling and field placement by BD to contain India to under 150.  But how will BD cope with the pitch conditions?? Hopefully it will improve in the second half.  If Tamim survives until 10th over, BD wins!!  And this may be Soumya's chance to get out of the rut and show his class. GO BD!!

Doni's lack of initiative &amp;tactics will hurt India badly. Going with  a totally inept batting, especially the middle order will knock India of WC. India keep playing the same inept batting in every match.

This is what happens when Kohli gets out early. The match is certainly not over but Bangladesh certainly have a chance. The captaincy was great and the bowling was extremely controlled, Pakistan needs to learn this from their younger brothers. With Tamim back they should go for the Indian bowlers in the power play and then go for singles. No big hitting is required when the score is below 150, the odd boundary will come. Go Bangladesh GO ! Embrace your moment and seal this Victory !

I don't think 140 is enough. India needs 160 to win this one. With some luck, BAN can score 50 in the power play and it will be their game to lose. Just as I write, Dhoni failed to hit a full toss for a six. Just give him lifetime achievement and pack him off to Rajya Sabha.

Rohit sharma should value his wicket more. He should know he is more than what he think he is, it doesn't matter if its powerplay or not, all he has to do is stick in there and he will end up with a match winning score. When will he know that? He should play for 20 overs he has such talent yet he plays for powerplay like a newbie.

When will he know that? He should play for 20 overs he has such talent yet he plays for powerplay like a newbie.

"Mustafizur is best in the world". What after 9 ODI and 10 T20's. No doubt he is a very good bowler. But giving the tag best in the world after 10 matches shows your arrogance and over confidence. Learn how to be down to earth from SA or NZ.

Both Sharma and Dhawan are looking insecure and  will waste powerplay.

Todays match is very imp for india. If india score 160 and above they have a chance less than that and india is in real trouble . Also india should take the wicket of tamim iqbal early in the innings other wise if he gets going it will be very tough for india.

When ever India and BD met each other in a ICC or ACC event the one thing that make proud for Bengali es of of Nations that the National Anthem of both teams is written by a Nobel laureate Bengali Rabindar Nath Tagore.
I am a Indian Bengali and always fell proud by watching this. And now lets play for fraternity and peace .

Coming from an SL fan : Dhoni's calmness is incomparable even to any of the calmest of captains this game has seen, like, steve waugh, richards, Hansie cronje, Ranatunga etc. Only insecured persons will shout out of minds during
victories as they think they dont deserve it. Even after winning as many 
world cups. this guy is all calmness.

You can get another Sachin/Akram/Lara/warne but can never get another Dhoni
in cricket

The way he said 'Out' after that last ball without too much emotion or spice shows what this man is upto. Fans of other countries (including my fella SL fans) should just admire and enjoy such games, learn the life lesson of composure of players like Dhoni, instead of claiming 'luck' etc.
Finally almost everyone is forgetting the role played by Nehra in this game. He mentored every bowler and also guided Dhoni all the way through and that is why Dhoni respects him so much.
Its either India or Australia who will win this world cup from her.
