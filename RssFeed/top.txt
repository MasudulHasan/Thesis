It was his time to depart. All of us are sent for a fixed time frame. There was nothing the cricketing fraternity could do to revive him once he collapsed much like Australian Opener Phil H. We have to return to our Creator and there is no denying the inevitable.

He most likely died of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. It most commonly occurs in young athletes, with African race being a risk factor. Very sad news.

Such sad news. There is a great enthusiasm for cricket in the rural Eastern Cape. This is the second promising player to pass away from there in recent memory. Condolences to the family and friends.

This is such a tragic news. Besides proper training at the nets the young players should also be aware of what to eat and drink.

Most of the young sport stars are so into power drinks and supplements for performance. Time for food war?

That is unfortunate ... How much fitness should you focus on? Where should you draw the line? These pertinent questions need urgent answers.

That is just tragic. This could easily have been James Taylor. It's an irony that his bad luck can be looked upon as fortunate, from a certain point of view. The case of Lukhanya Tsiki just highlights the need for every sport to be aware of the risks of sudden cardiac death and for world sport governing bodies to assist in the availability of suitable screening and education.

Very sad news...  And like all avoidable and tragic deaths of one so young, questions need to be asked. The obvious one is: are these cricketers subject to thorough health checks prior to undertaking intensive training routines? Surely they should be. Earlier this week the young, super fit and very promising James Taylor of England was diagnosed with a serious coronary condition that necessitates immediate surgery; it has brought an immediate end to his professional cricketing career.  His condition may have gone undetected had he not been subject to checks after feeling unwell. In this age of advanced medical science, such tragedies are usually avoidable and should not happen. Lessons must be learned.

Too much of fitness excercise may kill more sports person due to heart failure or heart attack in future that the sportsmen and their coach must remember.I being a sports medicine specialist has seen people trying too hard to develop their muscles through exercise by that ruining their cateers.because money plays a big role even cricket players do some weight excercise which are not required by ,most of them.Building muscles and performance are two different things.

This is very sad. Young man, just 22 years old. I hope, the CSA can provide his family with financial support and everything they need right now. Thoughts and prayers from BD.
