"@Akila93, I'll tell you why, scoring a triple century ",
on a small club ground want make a player worthy ,
at international level.,
There are so many other records like that ,
from bowlers/batsmen in domestic history.,
"But, every player who had that kind ",
of instant domestic records didn't get selected ,
"for national side, because records based ",
"on CONSISTENCY, such as batting averages",
 accumulated runs,
" number of 100s, 50s are the significant things reflecting ABILITY!",
Sanga showed his potential & skills right ,
from the beginning in domestic cricket with high averages as well as international level with decent scores in all conditions,
 without screwing the side like Kusal!,
Since July 2012 to the day he was axed July '1,
"3, Tharanga had played 20 ODIs-2 N/O",
 and accumulated 567 R at an Av ,
of 31.5 on home soil & lively decks!,
Is this inconsistency for a player ,
who had managed so many achievements right ,
from the day he began his Career?,
People like you are just thinking about favorites,
 not about SL!!,
!,
,
those who are slashing Kusal,
 those who think he doesn't have a proper technique,
" those who think he is mediocre,then ",
tell me why he is the only player ,
to score a triple century in SL club history,
 c'm on people he only played 28 odi,
 you cant expect every young batsman ,
to score like kohli,
" think about Sanga's odi career, people called him gandasthara, slashed ",
"at him, sanga's 1st 45 mtches- 3- 50's ",
" average 21.10, and took him 70 or 80 matches ",
to get his 1st 100,
 if people like you were there ,
"on selection panel, there will be no"" great Sanga",
""", on the other hand tharanga is tried ",
"and failed option, how many times he was given chances he scores once ",
in a while and fail 50 times,
,
Ireland match was a good eye-opener ,
for the responsible people in SL.,
We are about to lose 3 front-order experienced batsmen ,
in the near future.,
They were the players who shouldered ,
and absorbed the early breakdown pressure ,
in numerous occasions!,
"(since, Kusal opened the gate within the first 5 overs",
" 10 times in 17 innings that he opened, ",
since June 2013).,
"Dil, Sanga or Jaya somehow managed ",
to stable the dented ship and Mathews ,
with the help of lower order guys like Kulasekara,
" Thisara, Sachithra turned many ODIs to a winning streak ",
from a losing path!,
"Is there any logic or sense, trying ",
to develop a mediocre player like Kusal ,
at the expense of (DUMPING) an established young opener like Upul (29yrs) ,
with 5000+ Runs & a Batting Average 34.03 better than Jayawardane-32.77 or even Jayasuriya-32.51.???,
Specially at a time like this.??,
?,
,
"@ncpasan, Jayasuriya came as a bowler ",
and played lower down in the batting order,
 during the first few years of his career.,
His batting average at that stage appropriate to the position he played ,
as a bowler!,
"But, remember from the day he became an opener",
 he showed his class playing everywhere!,
Being an outstation boy,
 otherwise he wouldn't have survived a day ,
during that time!,
,
"@ncpasan, Kusal didn't open in that match",
 he came at number 4 and escaped twice due ,
to dropped catches to score 22 runs ,
 when chasing a small target like 75.,
Is this anything significant to brag about?,
Even Malinga had scored more than 50 runs,
 coming at number 11 to win a match ,
against Aus in Australia.,
To be an OPENER,
 he should show some potential,
 in his technique.,
"Unfortunately, anyone who had played cricket would see his bareness ",
in batting technicality.,
"Whether you like it or not, that is the naked truth pal!",
,
@King_Loyal I hope u were joking ,
when u said kulasekera should open.,
With all due respect to kula he is not a genuine batsman ,
besides his main duty is to bowl SL don't need a Irfan Pathan.,
I agree kusal is not ideal ,
in swinging conditions but he is still young ,
and he will learn remember jayasuriya didn't have any textbook technique yet scored a double century ,
in England.,
,
can't understand why all people are bashing KUSAL.,
People have forgotten that he's the only player ,
who played with ease to Johnson and co ,
in Australia in their 3rd ODI in Australia.,
That too was his debut series ,
at international level.,
FYI Jayasuriya's average in his first few years was ,
BELOW 20.,
So stop comparing his overall stats ,
with KUSAL.,
Give the lad some time to settle down.,
He'll be a great asset in the future especially ,
against fast bowlers.,

Irish bowlers were really good,
 especially Tim Murtagh utilized the seaming conditions and opener Kusal Perera's inability ,
to survive in such conditions,
 to the max!,
Irish fielding was superb throughout the match ,
and they made SL baiting survival limited ,
to the batting skills in the first hour of play!,
Too bad the 2nd match got washed away,
 they should have included a spare day.,
I'm sure Ireland will be the next test playing nation!,
,
He mantra lack of consistency is not Kusals problem.His performance is consistently poor,
,
not sure if kithruwan has the tekkers ,
to play at this level..kusal is still young stop bashing him !,
,
I think there too much expectation ,
"on Kusal, people expecting him to be the second birth ",
of Jaya and it win always remain a huge burden ,
for him.,
,
Kusal should bat at number 8 (hopefully he will not have ,
to face spinners or front line bowlers ,
at the death).,
Let the other guys carry the burden collectively,
 as they always did during the past year.,
Kulasekara can open the inning with someone,
 so the number 8 position becomes vacant for Kusal.,
"Need just 10 runs on the board, you are well set ",
for life!,
,
No need to bash kusal!,
he can continue!,
just drop kithruwan!,
he is very poor batsman!,
,
"Agree with Kapili_Buster, Ramansilva, king_loyal, St.John.",
"Hope Jaya, Mathew, Marvan and who ever responsible for the team selections will take these comments seriously.",
SL fans do not want to see another Mubarak episode ,
where even Dilshan was side lined.,
It is a shame if you keep Tharanga the most experienced opener ,
out of the team.,
Three cheers!!!,
to the Sri Lankan cricketers who performed well.,
Congratulations and Good Luck for the rest of the tour.,
Confident you will be successful throughout ,
if the selectors consider seriously the comments ,
by SL fans who truly love the game.,
,
Sri Lanka certainly looked the better side even ,
without the 5 regulars.,
I do endorse the views on Kushal Perera.,
Lets give him a few more games.,
Hope he will come good and not disappoint .,
I think the Irish are very competitive.,
Wish they get more exposure against quality sides like Sri Lanka,
,
No one can deny the visible facts & Stats!,
Can anyone justify a HYPED player like KUSAL ,
to be included in the ODI side looking ,
at his pathetic track record (17 Runs from 6 ODI Innings,
 Average 2.9 on fast-decks & poor overall average of 14.2 from 21 Innings-without Bangladesh & 26.95Av overall from 28 ODIs) ??,
His batting skills: 90% of the shots limited ,
to just a SLOG (swing across the line uppishly ,
to the cow corner) similar to any tail-ender!,
"In fact, Tailenders like Kula, Sachitra",
" Ajantha, Thisara etc.",
have displayed more strokes than him ,
on any deck facing pace & spin.!!,
"It's insane, trying to compare him ",
with an accomplished stroke-maker like Jaya... who had an array ,
of strokes around the wicket under any condition.,
"Reborn ""Avatar"" hype-ploy cannot hide the reality!",
50over ODIs are not T20 (where you may need tailender type hitting ,
at the top) Even in T20,
 we clearly saw what happened in the two occasions ,
that he had to face a spinner & a rare bouncy condition ,
in Chittagong...!,
,
At one stage Sri Lanka looked like they'd only manage 150-odd.,
Huge comeback from Kulasekera gave Sri Lanka a chance,
 then the Irish batsmen just wilted ,
under pressure from the bowlers.,
Kulasekera was my man of the match.,
Ireland were on top for at least the first 1/3rd ,
"of the match, but after that late order fightback it was all downhill.",
,
Congratulations to Sri Lanka team for keeping up the pressure ,
through good bowling right through the match.,
Kulasekera's batting and Mendis's first spell made the difference.,
Keep up the good work.,
,
I think Kusal needs to bat down the wicket ,
when he is playing swing bowling ,
in English conditions.,
Those edges that go to slip would come off the middle ,
of the bat more.,
There was probably not much Kusal could do.,
,
Very nice to see old good Chandimal.,
"His trademark pushes, flicks give us lot ",
of promise.,
But the problem is Kithuruwan with his poor technique,
 can he play in this level?,
Kusal has the same technical issues,
 but we need him.,
"He shouldn,t open in ODIs",
 maybe he has to bat at number 6-7.,
I think in few yeares he can open ,
for SL.,
,
KUsal must learn what consistency is.,
If he plays like this he would be a forgotten star and Likes will fade away ,
from him FB page,
,
Kusal needs to use his head more!,
"I know SL given him ""license ",
"to kill"" but please use some common sense.",
He can be great as Sanath ,
if he actually uses his brains.,
Sanath was great because he hit the ball ,
if it was there and and he also respected the good balls ,
by using soft hands to take a single.,
That's why Sanath was great and Kusal has a long way ,
to go to fill his boots.,
,
The lack of experience in the SL side was quite obvious.,
SL should have opted for an experienced player like Maharoof.,
"Still, it's good to see Chandimal getting back ",
on track...seems as if the captaincy burden really was the reason ,
for his lean patch in form.,
And give Kusal a chance to prove himself.,
"Yes, he is inconsistent",
 but he is still new to international cricket,
" and in time, perhaps he will become better...",
,
"Kusal Perera's "" Hit out or get out"" batting policy wont do.",
SL found a Jayasuriya-like opener,
" yes, but he hasn't Sanath's consistency...Far ",
from it.,
Top order batters look brittle.,
Middlesex bowler Murtagh (500 first class wickets) was almost unplayable...SL will meet many more like him ,
on the tour.,
,
congratzz both of you...,
,
@rk_ks I agree with you up ,
to some extent regarding chandimal's situation ,
at the WT20 cup.,
But we all know very well he is the best batsmen ,
at fast track.,
In sob continental pitch he getting more trouble.,
That is the issue he has.,
See his away records.,
That's are excellent.,
He is a good young batsmen.,
As sri lankan we hope highly ,
in future.,
,
Hard fought win.,
It seems like associates are continue ,
to fail with SL.,
Common Irish.,
Kick them on next game,
,
Thanks Ireland cricket for uploading in youtube .,
And guess what .,
there are no advertisements.,
Some Irish commentators .Primitive but i liked it .,
,
Its virtually unwritten game but with lots of importance.,
Each an every game Ireland playing against full member is lot ,
for their exposure .,
SL tried with youngsters to see ,
how they look like .,
Good game and some dredit to Irish bowlers ,
as they tightened our batsmen .,
it s their batting against our bowling let them down .,
I really don t mind an Irish win ,
of Thursday .,
They deserve something .,
,
@ rk_ks what about your Yuvraj?,
He won two world cups for India ,
and you people condemned him for playing a single faulty innings?,
How patriotic is that?,
,
"yes, Malinga has been rested; to play IPL.",
,
"@Kepili_Buster and @Ramansilva, you guys forgot ",
how he played in Australia last time.,
He has the talent and surely will produce better results ,
when the tour goes on.,
Mark my words.,
,
Mr. rk_ks Chandimal is one of future prospect ,
for srilanka.. no need to remind his100 ,
against england in their own backyard so hope you are an indian lad & ,
what i have to say is this team rested their 6 seniors & still it is good ,
in all areas than Ireland in their own conditions &this Ireland conditions are tough ,
to adjust quickly & it was the first game so I'm not saying it was a great performance but lions will come back strongly ,
in second match & then in the england series either..,
Still kusal & vithanage need to find their feets ,
in fast tracks If the young blood find their feets & ,
with seniors coming to scenario hell ,
,
If the young blood find their feets & ,
with seniors coming to scenario hell ,
,
I support the claims of Kepili_Buster.,
Although Kusal Perera was hyped and given so many chances he was more dissapointing ,
than entertaining.,
Sanath Jayasuriya probably wants Kusal to emulate him but so far he has mostly failed.,
Kepili_Buster's stats prove that.,
SL team should have a dependabel opener like Tharanga ,
to hold fort not a gate opener like Kusal.,
,
@rk_ks Chandimal is good batsman .,
but last few years he was not good ,
with bat .,
He can come back his class act any time .,
Every batsman has such time .,
need time to adjust .,
hope he would be get going ,
for this tour.,
Don't forget he scored 100 runs ,
against England in Loards .,
,
Kusal has to learn from Jayasuriya ,
how to play in these conditions.,
,
Malinga rested ?,
Is it a joke,
 he would be playing '16' T20's ,
"in India now , remember IPL",
,
@Tinybaba seriously??,
they are just rested for the two matches ,
against Irelend.,
They are there for the English games.,
,
We have rested ( or was it dropped) Mahela and Sanga ,
from Irish leg of British Isles tour and with that goes out the most experience batsmen ,
in the world now in these tricky conditions.,
Politics is killing sports like everything else ,
in Srilanka.,
I earnestly hope ,
 out so called administrators will learn a lesson ,
from these things one day.,
,
"@eZoha, Malinga is being rested along ",
with the other seniors.,
,
Well done SL in alien cold,
 wet and blustery conditions.,
It would be unfair to say ,
that the SL XI was a second eleven.,
"Kula, Angelo, Chandi, Sachitra (and even) Mendis are now senior players ",
who have all but assured places ,
in the first team.,
Add to that Kusal who is a selector's favourite ,
and is undroppable right now and you have got a fair dinkum national line-up.,
"That said, Thisara instead of Vithanage would have made a better balanced line-up.",
SL must help the Associates remembering its own cricket starved experience pre-1982.,
SL played Netherlands in 2006 and this time its Ireland.,
Maybe we can ask for reciprocal assistance ,
"with football and rugby union, respectively :)",
