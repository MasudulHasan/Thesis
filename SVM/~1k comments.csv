"Rohit sharmas innings was actually slow in the middle overs and it was only butlers hits that gave MI the impetus and reduced the deficit between balls left and runs required, which brought MI close. Rohit then hit a few fours right at the end and improved his strike rate. So butler was the man largely responsible for MI victory. This is not something new about Rohit but people miss it often. Amongst others, parthiv patel just doesnt fit in. A score of 23 off 20 balls does not augur well for MI if they play him in other matches. Even pandya has been far from impressive and hasnt shown the form he showed on his debut. It is only the foreign players who seem to be capable of winning matches. I hope MI select some good indian players in future editions of IPL and promote local talent instead of parthiv patel.'",Negative

His partner Uthappa cannot score against quality bowling which has been proved time and again. Seems they have missed the trick this season.

While they have a few good desi batsmen (specially Manish), their top paid players Ghamvir and Narine are not going to be enough. MI's top players like Rohit, Butler, Bumrah, Mcclenghan, Harbhajan played well. These guys(except Harbhajan) are the better players of their national team. Sakib's bowling is no longer as threatening as it used to be(Tamim, MohmadUllah, Shabbir, Taskin, Mustafiz, AlAmin are Bangladesh's top players these days).

At one stage what looks like a score of 200 plus ended up scoring 187. Thanks to Gambhir. If a batsman who opens an inning and cannot score at the rate of 2 runs/per ball after he plays 35 balls should give away his wicket and let the others to the power hitting.',Negative

He is over the hill and has peaked and cannot perform at this level.India should discard Dhawan.KKR has serious thinking to do because of they can't afford passengers like Yusuf who are soo way past their sell by date that it's hard to fathom they are playing at this level. Narine/Shakib had to be on this pitch. Gambhir also batting slow but at least he is batting unlike Dhawan who cannot last more than 3-4 overs in any format now. Also soon I think SL will be pushed out of full membership and will play with associates. There are more BD players than SL players this season.

"@BARUN SHARMA: I already stated that my bet is with Manish Pandey to replace Yuvraj. What will Dhoni & Shastri do is anybody's guess! Dhoni has his own logic which includes Unchanged XI, whether it is balanced or not. In my opinion, Raina is NOT a #4 bat but it is Dhoni's decision. MSD puts Raina there with a vain hope that he can hit any bowling. Rohit & Dhawan fail in 3 out of 4 outings especially when they play world class bowlers on spicy pitches. Both Rahane & Pandey are proper batsmen but they have no chance of getting in XI till Dhoni's unchanged XI has an injury. Now that vacancy has arisen, it is rumoured that he is entertaining the thought of including Negi to replace Yuvraj- a frightening thought when India has 3 out of top 4 bats failing consistently. Is this Indian XI or Dhoni's XI? Has Rationality no place in XI selection?""",Negative
"@Barunsharma : Small trivia for you. Sachin took 78 matches to score his first century.. If anyone had expected instant results from him, we wouldn't have seen Sachin. Give Hardik Pandya time. 50 Odis T20 Min before coming to a conclusion. And India needs proper 4 batsmen excluding MSD. So including Pandey or Rahane is a clear selection choice. I fear MSD and Ravi Shastri will select Negi expecting him to score a quick fire 20 25. What if situation requires consolidation over explosiveness.. Logical choice is to include Pandey or Rahane in place of Yuvraj.""",Negative
"@Nampally ""India has 3 more all rounders in Jadeja, Pandya & Ashwin"" on paper yeah but in reality Jadeja is worse batsmen of them all in T20I\'s. Ashwin at best strikes at 100 S/R which is no good for late order hitter. So his position as a allrounder is also not discounted in batting order. Now its only left to Pandya who is more suited to order of his batting. For me Yuvi @ 5 was a big hit if you consider match situations. Dhoni cleverly sends Yuvi for consolidation which he is doing aplomb. Yuvi did fail in Accelerating . Now about Raina only good innings he had after long time was against Bangla that too he couldn\'t build on it. Being in Bangalore where ground size should help Raina for his lofted shots this was his best shot to come back to form against supposedly weaker bowling he did top score but was edgy at his best. Rohit is still living in his past glory and was making sure India score less then 30 against OZ (17 b 12 runs) . Shikhar always looks in form n gets OUT in WC!'",Negative

"@Nampally You assume things a lot. Suresh Raina was power hitter earlier because he used to bat down the order earlier. The same was the case with Yuvraj. When someone coming at batting order 3 and 4, what their role should be to stabilize team and provide momentum for the final push during last overs. Nowadays, Role of Raina and Yuvi are different and don't expect them to play power hitters all the time but yes, It is expected the role of power hitters from Jadeja, Pandya and others who bat down the order. Raina definitely failed in his new role but I don't agree with Yuvi. He always delivered when India needed except one or two fails. I have a lot doubt with Rahane. After given so many opportunities, he couldn't prove that he is really a T20 player. Definitely, he is a very good batsman for Test and ODIs but T20 isn't meant for him.

Kohli is the ""One-Man"" batting who has literally carried India into the Semi Final, at least in batting. India needed someone like Rahane or Pandey to strengthen their batting at #4. Raina, as free swinger, is at best a #6 bat NOT #4.Dhoni wants to bat at #6 rather than #4.Despite missing #4, India somehow managed to reach the Semi. Now Yuvraj out with injury, India needs a specialist bat @#4. My bet is it will be Manish Pandey who gets the nod. Thought of including Negi is infantile & hope Dhoni will not entertain it.

He is unlikely to drop Raina, even though Raina has been the worst batsmen of all sides in this tournament. There is a case for Dhawan being replaced by Rahane, but I doubt if Dhoni will do that (unfortunately, Rahane himself has been desperately poor in many of the recent matches). He is unlikely to drop Rohit because of his phenomenal past record against WI and AU on flat pitches.

Raina is drained of runs, he only has 3 t20 international 50's ever, none since 2010. This last 50 was against Zimbabwe. His last significant innings was Against Australia a 49* that won us the game. There has been a massive decrease in run scoring from this player over the last 3 years. Not many T20i's sides have a number 4 with no half centuries in the last 5 years. Rohit on the other hand has recently improved consistent performances in Australia and a century against South Africa and a match winning 83 against Bangladesh in the Asia cup suggest this player is growing better.

By now Rahane should have been the Mr.Dependable opener who could play his shots up the order and anchor the innings, but Kohli has been doing that as a single guy... If wankhede pitch is flat, Rohith and Dhawan will thrive but that performance will definitely allow them a cushion of 10 more matches...

Yuvraj has played a stellar role in a few matches, his contribution has been immense for India in some of the difficult matches they played against Pakistan and Australia, but clearly his time is over and this could be his swansong. Dhawan always looks in form, but consistency is a challenge. Rohit Sharma clearly is a king on flat tracks, but you dish out difficult tracks to him - pace, bounce, swing, spin and high quality bowlers and he is found out. Temperament is a challenge with him guess that's why he is not successful in tests. Still he is an asset in the short forms.

I would refrain from making any changes in the WC unless Yuvraj gets injured. Manish should then probably replace him, Rahane suits more as an opener. India is currently winning owing to Kohli's batting, the immense contribution from their bowling and fielding and Dhoni's astute captaincy. Beauty of T20 cricket is that one player can carry most of the team and still win the match, which Kohli is doing via his batting. India must thank their fortune that they have Nehra & Bumrah who have turned around India's bowling stocks immensely, its pretty unbelievable that two months back no one would have seen them as being India's bowling spearhead in the WC. With all the batting frailties, India still look favorites because of Kohli's hunger & because of the fact that Dhoni likes to write his own script.""",Positive

"The only possibility for a replacement is if Yuvraj is not fit. In that case MSD might play Pandey as a lower order batsman as Rahane can play only in top 3.

Bowlers feared to face Sehwag, Sachin / Ganguly/Gambir (on several occassions), but the case with Nohit is, they know that he will eat balls to get to that mood of hitting. So till then, it is benefit to them (may be 10 to 12 dot balls) and then, they will work him out, by inducing him to play some non-sense shots due to pressure of those dot balls, why he made himself. I also beleive Nohit gets praised by all commentators for his LAZY Elegance, all the Timing he has got playing shots, blah blah blah etc repeatedly, so IND can put up with him eternally for his once in blue moon performance.

I don't see Dhawan-Rohit combo broken as MSD has faith in Dhawan who can suddenly up his game in a finals as he usually does. It will be a miracle if Windies don't target Dhawan, Raina and Yuvi with bouncers. It will be aplenty in display and how these three cope up will determine the results. Ash once again will be key and its hard for Jaddu to keep firing all 6 balls on the toes of some of the biggest hitters in the game.

"This is more about being fair to all players. Players like dhawan and raina seem to be receiving unlimited chances over the last few years and their scores have not justified their assured place in the team, no matter how many times they fail. Rahane who has been outstanding in the last few years, especially on fast pitches and against quality pace attacks, has been a passenger without getting a fair number of chances. Also dhoni now talks about players making certain spots their own by peforming solidly but in the Bangladesh series, rahane who had performed well in the middle order, was shuffled in the batting order just to accommodate rohit sharma. And we have seen that the constant failures of dhawan, raina etc have been covered only by Kohli's brilliance otherwise India would have been out in the first round itself, so it is high time dhoni selects the team keeping the teams best interests in mind.""",Negative

He will hang in there and provide a helping hand to his team. Asia cup and this world cup against Pakistan he was at the other end when Kohli was winning the world over.

India needed partnerships when Yuvi had walked in. Not fast runs. He has provided exactly what team needed at that stage without worrying about personal gains. A lesser character would have tried to slog and show he is in good touch to keep his place in team. But this guy did what was needed in previous games as well.',Positive

Yet, he is conveniently dropped to find a place for Raina. Yuvraj is a past star. You don't play a world cupt with a half fit past star. In his place Manish Pandey should have been in. Similarly Akshar Patel (in place of another past star Nehra) should play in the team. One can understand chances given to Dhawan and Rohit. Both have immense talent, but it is high time they show it in performance. India is a Nation of 1.25 billion. Our talent pool is rich. But favouritism is ruining the performance.

He was a liability in the last match too. But Kohli's brilliance his the weaknesses of the other batsmen. All that Kohli needed in his current form was a kid with a stick who can give the strike back to him and keep pace with him, which MSD did. Yuvi with his injury and poor running almost made a mess of that match. Rest of the batsmen too are not in any form worth mentioning. Let us hope at least a couple of others steps up in the semi's Cheers!""",Negative
"The author is not being fair to Yuvraj. Yuvraj may not be at his fluent best , but he had to rebuild the innings with Kohli on with India losing the top 3 with little on the board.These were knockout matches high-pressure situations while chasing but let's not be uncharitable , but for those partnerships, India would have lost against Pakistan . It was unfortunate he got injured else he might have added a few more run to the total. He has also contributed with the ball as well. The problem for India is the lower order , they hardly infuse any confidence , once we lose top 6 there is no stokes/butler /mmali .""",Positive
"Yuvi, Raina, Rohit and Dhawan has been feeding on the brilliance of Kohli in the recent past. Kohli may be the best in world cricket today, but he too will perish if he has to continue shouldering such pressure for long. It will be good if Yuvi's injury keeps him out of the future matches. This will allow Pandey to take his place. It would be good if Rahane or even Negi comes in place of Raina. As of now don't think we have any better options for openers, as we have already seen that Rahane is also Vulnerable against pace and swing initially, but he sure may do better than Dhawan or Rohit if given a longer rope. Let us hope that other batsmen also fire in the semi's as we need all guns blazing if Gayle has a good day. Cheers!""",Neutral

@Akila93, Are you saying, SL should eliminate an established young player with so much experience, solid international track-record to prove his consistency & skills should be eliminated to include a flat-deck player like Kusal, who had been given ample opportunities and failed miserably outside Bangladesh (Av 14.2 from 21 ODIs)! Are you saying the SL player who has the Highest Batting Average (69.4) with more than 300 Runs in England vs Eng should be dropped, to make room for a Gate-Opener like Kusal ? Tell me a single valid reason, why a player like Upul had been eliminated from the Central Contract & Squads during the past year, despite having such an incomparable batting record in the recent past & whole international career? Facts & Stats can't hide! I hope the Selectors will do a proper job for SL this time, rather than batting for privileged!

@Akila93, I'll tell you why, scoring a triple century on a small club ground want make a player worthy at international level. There are so many other records like that from bowlers/batsmen in domestic history. But, every player who had that kind of instant domestic records didn't get selected for national side, because records based on CONSISTENCY, such as batting averages, accumulated runs, number of 100s, 50s are the significant things reflecting ABILITY! Sanga showed his potential & skills right from the beginning in domestic cricket with high averages as well as international level with decent scores in all conditions, without screwing the side like Kusal! Since July 2012 to the day he was axed July '13, Tharanga had played 20 ODIs-2 N/O, and accumulated 567 R at an Av of 31.5 on home soil & lively decks! Is this inconsistency for a player who had managed so many achievements right from the day he began his Career? People like you are just thinking about favorites, not about SL!!!

those who are slashing Kusal, those who think he doesn't have a proper technique, those who think he is mediocre,then tell me why he is the only player to score a triple century in SL club history,  c'm on people he only played 28 odi, you cant expect every young batsman to score like kohli, think about Sanga's odi career, people called him gandasthara, slashed at him, sanga's 1st 45 mtches- 3- 50's , average 21.10, and took him 70 or 80 matches to get his 1st 100, if people like you were there on selection panel, there will be no"" great Sanga"", on the other hand tharanga is tried and failed option, how many times he was given chances he scores once in a while and fail 50 times, it better give chance to much younger player

Ireland match was a good eye-opener for the responsible people in SL. We are about to lose 3 front-order experienced batsmen in the near future. They were the players who shouldered and absorbed the early breakdown pressure in numerous occasions! (since, Kusal opened the gate within the first 5 overs, 10 times in 17 innings that he opened, since June 2013). Dil, Sanga or Jaya somehow managed to stable the dented ship and Mathews with the help of lower order guys like Kulasekara, Thisara, Sachithra turned many ODIs to a winning streak from a losing path! Is there any logic or sense, trying to develop a mediocre player like Kusal at the expense of (DUMPING) an established young opener like Upul (29yrs) with 5000+ Runs & a Batting Average 34.03 better than Jayawardane-32.77 or even Jayasuriya-32.51.??? Specially at a time like this.???

@ncpasan, Jayasuriya came as a bowler and played lower down in the batting order, during the first few years of his career. His batting average at that stage appropriate to the position he played as a bowler! But, remember from the day he became an opener, he showed his class playing everywhere! Being an outstation boy, otherwise he wouldn't have survived a day during that time!
 
",Positive
"
 
@ncpasan,   Kusal didn't open in that match, he came at number 4 and escaped twice due to dropped catches to  score 22 runs , when chasing  a small target like 75.  Is this anything significant to brag about? Even Malinga had scored more than 50 runs, coming at number 11 to win a match against Aus in Australia.  To be an OPENER, he should show some potential, in his technique.  Unfortunately, anyone who had played cricket would see his bareness in batting technicality.  Whether you like it or not, that is the naked truth pal!

@King_Loyal I hope u were joking when u said kulasekera should open. With all due respect to kula he is not a genuine batsman besides his main duty is to bowl SL don't need a Irfan Pathan.

can't understand why all people are bashing KUSAL. People have forgotten that he's the only player who played with ease to Johnson and co in Australia in their 3rd ODI in Australia. That too was his debut series at international level. 
 
 
FYI Jayasuriya's average in his first few years was BELOW 20. So stop comparing his overall stats with KUSAL. Give the lad some time to settle down. He'll be a great asset in the future especially against fast bowlers.

Irish bowlers were really good, especially Tim Murtagh utilized the seaming conditions and opener Kusal Perera's inability to survive in such conditions, to the max!

Kusal should bat at number 8 (hopefully he will not have to face spinners or front line bowlers at the death).

No one can deny the visible facts & Stats! Can anyone justify a HYPED player like KUSAL to be included in the ODI side looking at his pathetic track record (17 Runs from 6 ODI Innings, Average 2.9 on fast-decks & poor overall average of 14.2 from 21 Innings-without Bangladesh & 26.95Av overall from 28 ODIs) ?? His batting skills: 90% of the shots limited to just a SLOG (swing across the line uppishly to the cow corner) similar to any tail-ender! In fact, Tailenders like Kula, Sachitra, Ajantha, Thisara etc. have displayed more strokes than him on any deck facing pace & spin.!! It's insane, trying to compare him with an accomplished stroke-maker like Jaya... who had an array of strokes around the wicket under any condition. Reborn ""Avatar"" hype-ploy cannot hide the reality! 50over ODIs are not T20 (where you may need tailender type hitting at the top)
Even in T20, we clearly saw what happened in the two occasions that he had to face a spinner & a rare bouncy condition in Chittagong...!

At one stage Sri Lanka looked like they'd only manage 150-odd.  Huge comeback from Kulasekera gave Sri Lanka a chance, then the Irish batsmen just wilted under pressure from the bowlers.  Kulasekera was my man of the match.  Ireland were on top for at least the first 1/3rd of the match, but after that late order fightback it was all downhill.

Very nice to see old good Chandimal. His trademark pushes, flicks give us lot of promise.
 But the problem is Kithuruwan with his poor technique, can he play in this level?

Kusal needs to use his head more! I know SL given him ""license to kill"" but please use some common sense. He can be great as Sanath if he actually uses his brains. Sanath was great because he hit the ball if it was there and and he also respected the good balls by using soft hands to take a single. That's why Sanath was great and Kusal has a long way to go to fill his boots.

The lack of experience in the SL side was quite obvious. SL should have opted for an experienced player like Maharoof. Still, it's good to see Chandimal getting back on track...seems as if the captaincy burden really was the reason for his lean patch in form. And give Kusal a chance to prove himself. Yes, he is inconsistent, but he is still new to international cricket, and in time, perhaps he will become better...

Kusal Perera's  "" Hit out or get out"" batting policy wont do. SL found a Jayasuriya-like opener, yes, but he hasn't Sanath's consistency...Far from it. Top order batters look brittle.

Well done SL in alien cold, wet and blustery conditions. It would be unfair to say that the SL XI was a second eleven. Kula, Angelo, Chandi, Sachitra (and even) Mendis are now senior players who have all but assured places in the first team. Add to that Kusal who is a selector's favourite and is undroppable right now and you have got a fair dinkum national line-up. That said, Thisara instead of Vithanage would have made a better balanced line-up. SL must help the Associates remembering its own cricket starved experience pre-1982. SL played Netherlands in 2006 and this time its Ireland. Maybe we can ask for reciprocal assistance with football and rugby union, respectively :)

No matter weather SL win or lose, these guys plus a few other super guys like Mubarak, Rambukwella, Rajapaksa etc. should be eventually added to the side, eliminating a few more Batsmen like Chandi, Thiri, Priyanjan, Dilshan etc before the WC. They don't belong to the privileged class blessed by the lord. Therefore, easily dispensable like Tharanga, since there are no hype bubbles or power shields to protect. If someone is doing anything different, that is unfair! This is a must in SL cricket, purely for the sake of our own fantasy & enjoyment.

The gate has been opened yet again by KUSAL PERERA for the SIXTH CONSECUTIVE TIME on fast-decks in pace friendly conditions with another FOUR-ball DUCK!! He has not survived more than 10 Balls in six consecutive matches, played in these conditions! If someone is trying to justify his inclusion then it can't be for the interest of SL Cricket! This is his career record on fast decks: 0 Runs -(1 Balls v NZ -Cardiff -9/06/13) (6 R -10 B -v Eng- The Oval-13/06/13) (4 R-2 B -v Aus-The Oval -17/06/13) (4 R-10 B -v India -Cardiff -20/06/13) (2 R-1 B -v India -Port of Spain -11/07/13)( 0 R - 4 B -v Ireland - 06/05/14). The other Guy who DOESN'T BELONG IN THE SQUAD is KITHU VITHANAGE . He is the only other guy who couldn't survive 5 balls! UPUL THARANGA & DINESH CHANDIMAL Showed how valuable they are in these conditions.

SL badly needs an experienced OPENER to stem the inning in upcoming ODI series & for the future, including WC. Wasting anymore time with a substandard guy, who was parachuted to the ODI side in 2013, at the expense of 8th highest all time Run-maker for SL, is a CRIME! Persisting with an unskilled, substandard opener like KUSAL would certainly cost heavily for SL, in the Eng series as well as 2015 WC! He has managed just 17 RUNS in SIX consecutive innings at an astonishing AVERAGE of 2.9 on lively Fast-decks! Whenever he appear in these conditions,  the lacking skills are clearly visible! How on earth, a player like him GET REPEATEDLY SELECTED  for 50 over games? IT is high time for Sanath to bring back SL's most experienced young 28yr opener Upul Tharanga, who has scored 13 CENTURIES + 28x50s all over the world in ODIs. This includes 2 CENTURIES vs Eng in England. This is Tharanga's  Record in Eng: Batting Average 69.40  -S/R 84.42 -  5 Inning -347 Runs - 100sx2 + 50sx1  (HS 120)..!!!

I do not agree with the statement ""Chandimal is our best batsman.."". He shows promise but he is yet to prove consistency. Malinga was playing a couple of hour earlier at IPL and he is very much a MI key player. It is a shame that IPL gets the better of representing ones motherland. No doubt he will join the SL team when IPL finishes end of this month.

Sri Lanka only gets a series against England beginning of summer or end of spring when weather is horrible and very cold. This series is no different and Sri Lanka might suffer beginning of the series. If they give SL a series middle of summer, SL will thrash England is style. England has experienced that couple years ago and now very careful when to give a series to SL. Also people who consider SL flat track bullies...I just have to say England, Australia and South Africa can play only in faster wickets. So ICC rating about test rankings i disagree. Australia got to play in sub continent, win matches to be # 1 Test ranking team in the World.

The gate has been opened yet again by KUSAL PERERA for the SIXTH CONSECUTIVE TIME on fast-decks in pace friendly conditions with another FOUR-ball DUCK!! He has not survived more than 10 Balls in six consecutive matches, played in these conditions! If someone is trying to justify his inclusion then it can't be for the interest of SL Cricket!  This is his career record on fast decks:  0 Runs -(1 Balls v NZ -Cardiff -9/06/13) (6 R -10 B -v Eng- The Oval-13/06/13) (4 R-2 B -v Aus-The Oval -17/06/13) (4 R-10 B -v India -Cardiff -20/06/13) (2 R-1 B -v India -Port of Spain -11/07/13)( 0 R - 4 B -v Ireland - 06/05/14). The other Guy who DOESN'T BELONG IN THE SQUAD is KITHU VITHANAGE .  He is the only other guy who couldn't survive 5 balls! UPUL THARANGA  & DINESH CHANDIMAL Showed  how valuable they are in these conditions.  If not for experienced Upul's role as an opener, SL could have collapsed further from that 2 down situation,SL desperately need the service of Upul Tharanga in ODIs/Tests

Quite a number of folks here are dissing Tharanga little realising that the matches are being played on seaming pitches in Ireland/ England in EARLY  Summer - Kusal Perera's technique is not suited to play the moving ball - Tharanga has plenty of experience of batting when its nippy . 
 
 
Only Sanga , Tharanga , Mahela and Prasanna Jayawardena have the technique to stand the scrutiny of Anderson and Co. in test matches.Marvan should seriously consider playing 3 opening batsmen in the tests to protect the big 2 in the middle.Sunil Gavaskar was a proponent of the 3 opening batsmen in seaming and bouncy tracks .

Why use Chandimal instead of Kusal Perera, as the Keeper??? Is this an attempt to squeeze in the out-of-form Chandimal in to the playing 11?

He is the ""Dilhara Fernando"" in SL batting line up!

First of all we can't do experiments in upcoming matches before WC, we have to give enough exposure to the certain players who will be in the WC squad 2015.Marwan also had mentioned that plan before they were leaving to this tour.

YsaKaru: There are many great ODI batsmen who have started slowly but later blossomed into top quality batters. Sanath Jayasuriya is one of them.

Probably it is matter adjusting to a different role in ODIs.

No doubt Sri Lanka are a good team. But with a weakened team, the first match in foreign conditions, and if the Irish crowd can get going like they did against England, I can only see one result.
 
 
Ireland have some quality players but lack depth. Tim Murtagh has been a quality performer in county cricket for years, so it's no wonder he chose to qualify for Ireland and take his opportunity of county cricket. Dockrell and Stirling are quality young players.Joyce is in excellent form from playing for Sussex.
 
 
The O'brien brothers are no doubt talented. I'm sure Kevin would benefit from some time in county cricket, otherwise he is in danger of being a one innings wonder.
 
 
Porterfield is no doubt an excellent leader, and he scored a true captain's hundred vs England, but I have doubts about him. His county record isn't great and suggests a lack of quality, which for me explains why his batting always seems too pedestrian.
 
 
Hopefully with Ashley Giles gone, Rankin can go back to Ireland

It's nice way to start the English tour winning two out of two. But.... this won't be a walk in the park as Ireland have given enough headaches to visiting Test playing countries. Resting veterans and insert untested budding youth would not be the ideal way to begin the tour. 
 
 
Since Marvan is debuting coaching stint at International scene he would need all Assistant coaches and support staff to do their part fully well.
 
 
Then, Angelo and Thirimanne should lead from the front in every facets of the game. The task thereafter would be relatively easier than making it tough for themselves.

I hate to write my view but here it goes. You search or learn things what you do not have. If you want to learn psychology means you are lacking in reading people's minds. You want to improve upon it. There is only one spot i play behardien. Opening in ODI and T20. He really can't shine in 6th spot. He need to go on attack from first ball. If it works , you will have long carrier. I like mentally strong players in 6,7,8 th spot. Warrior , Courage , guts type player has to open the inning.  They have peak energy short period of time. So they excel only in those circumstances.

Behardien jury is still out for me sure he needs more opportunities to bat long but he needs to start making more runs soon almost 50 odis and still no century sure he is the finisher but I haven't seen him finish to many games yet man South Africa never used to have bits n pieces players like that they all used to be quality players now it's only ab and Amla that stand out as being top class players the rest are pretty average so I fear for South African cricket

I can only laugh at @SANDY_BANGALORE's comments.
First of all, he used to bat at no. 3 for mumbai often facing the new ball and still averaged 60. Secondly, batting at no. 6 in tests is also an art coz it involves batting with tailenders and still scoring runs. Also, there is the factor of the 2nd new ball as well. Thirdly, he needs to open the innings in t20s, thats where he can be of good value to the team. If the management asks him to bat lower it is not his fault. Fourthly, he should be given few more chances consistently at no. 4 in ODIs, at least half the chances we have given to Rohit and he will definitely do well.
I think he is a really good batsman, a complete team player. Just that he needs to be backed by the captain and not criticized in public like Dhoni did.

",Positive

I would rate him as the best batsman in the current indian TEST squad. He is the best, above Kohli. Kohli lacks solid back foot play on offside. I have rarely seen him playing a solid square cut or back foot drives on offside. With out these shots, IMO, its tough to survive good bowling on good tracks. Rahane has EVERY shot in the book. If Rahane can crub his stroke making in the begining of the innings and build, he will do even better. In ODIs he should come as opener. Dhawan is a sitting duck.
 
",Positive
"
 
I speak absolute truth if it exists. :). I can not change my opinion what i can't see. Rahane has very compact technique when ball bounce well. He can crack square drive or what ever in off side only if ball bounces. He get bogged down in slow wickets. Simple reason he really can not generate power on ball that comes slow.  When ball travelling fast , it is easy to hit ball with touch and timing. When you have weak legs you really can not generate power even if you have world biggest biceps. strong leg is foundation for great player. You may ask how sachin played well?  He could angle ball and bid time. He did n't bull doze because he did n't have power. You need two things. 1. Methodology (just copy how sachin managed that). 2. technique ( each body is different. So you have to find your own way. This always depends on body strength. If you have strong legs , you can have leeway in technique).  Sehwag able to hit big shots because he had strong legs. Being fit is just not enough.

Now there's a team player for u he even enjoys carrying the drinks not often u here people say that he's a total pro he may not get the credit like kohli does but he's just as important to the team he's versatile he could bat anywhere in the order and adjust accordingly but 5 in tests is agood spot for him where he can face the old and then 2nd new ball a player like that is vital so u kind of have a reserve opener in case one of the regular openers get injured during the test so rahane is very important to Indian cricket everything he says makes a lot of sense to me

Such an accomplished and reliable player, I do rate Rahane as high as Rahul Dravid. It is wrong to compare him with Shikar Dhawan, who has a different style. People keep questioning about his abilities in limited over cricket. He may not be flamboyant like a Dhawan or Kohli, but definitely brings stability to the innings. He goes about his batting quietly and his runs provide testimony for his competence. Here are comparative statistics for Dhawan and Rahane: Test Series: Dhawan: 19 tests - 1308 runs - 4 hundreds and 2 50s, ave: 40.87 , Rahane: 22 tests - 1619 runs - 6 hundres and 7 50s Ave:44.97; ODI: Dhawan: 74 matches 3078 runs, 9 100s, 17 50s, Ave: 43.97, SR: 90; Rahane: 67 matches, 2093 runs 2 100s, 15 50s, Ave: 33.22 SR: 79.61; T20I: Dhawan: 22 matches, 416 runs, 2 50s, Ave: 20.8, SR:113.35; Rahane: 18 Matches, 364 rubs, 1 50, Ave: 21.41, SR:113.75 - That clearly provides the comparison if any, disproving that Dhawan is much faster in T20s.
 
",Positive
"
 
He would walk into any team of the world in test matches. I have no doubt that he will become one of the batting greats. India should utilise him as an opener in ODIs but should not play him in T20s. In tests he should bat at no 3. And Pujara should open with Vijay. He can actually play a role like ponting coz  he is a great stroke maker. And Pujara is too good to be let out. That will also give Rohit a no. 5 place. Coz no matter how much people troll him, the day he finds his mojo in tests, he will score effortlessly. Look at his Ranji record. But if Pujara fails at the top then Rahul should open and Rahane can come to no. 5 with Pujara at no. 3. 
 
 
Also India needs a keeper as good as Saha but much better batsman. Saha can keep and end and a fighter but they need a stroke maker at no. 6. Someone who is feared like Stokes, Prior.

I think he's a rather overrated cricketer! And its easy to prove why. In ODI's and T20's there have been innumerable instances where he got bogged down and dragged down the run rate. While at the other end Shikhar was blazing away, and thus Shikhar had to compensate for Rahanes slowness and gets out. We saw that very cleraly in the T20 world cup, atleast once.And this put a lot of pressure on the likes of Yuvi and Hardik down the order. Yes, we have seen him play strokes in IPL, but that are on flat pitches and against medium pace. Never ever seen him comfortable against quality pace. And in Test matches, he has the best position of all..no 6. As an opener, you are expected to face the fresh new ball, and at No 6, he is shielded from all that, and makes runs when the opponents are tiring. Not a bad cricketer, but just that he is a quiet person dosent make him a great player like a few Indian fans think. I feel that the likes of Pandya, Raina have got far greater match turning potential
",Negative

ALEXK400- Are you joking? Rahane is one of the most fit players in the team, I only think Dhoni and Kohli are faster between the wickets than him. Furthermore his technique isn't built around hitting double hundreds in ODI's but guarantee in a test match Rohit will outperform Rahane only when pigs fly. The guy should've been in the team 5 years ago when he started scoring gigantic Ranji runs, pity that India and their ""legends"" didn't give him a chance by occupying spots in the team. A really hard worker, the most technically secure batsman in the team and the guy you see in the middle order as opposition and realise the hard work has only just begun. Nothing but admiration for him as a player on and off the field, especially as a player who came into the team and has done nothing but perform right from the start which is rare for every country let alone India.

He is physicall weak. He runs out of energy so quick and gets out when india need him badly. he needs to bulk up and operate at cool 55% efficiency and make double hundred every inning. Do not let someone else do the job. Manage the energy and tough it out. Bid time if bowler bowls well. Some time people lose concentration is they do not touch the ball few overs. It happens to people who lacks energy.  Strong legs is key. Just imagine crease is your home and you are not leaving. Rahane is certainly have conpact technique. Kinda pocket dynamo but he lose concentration often and get out. I think it is due to lack of physical strength that affects his brain. Also film study on bowlers help in finding best scoring stroke against each bowler and where he bowls. Also if there is a way they can put a glass in helmet it allow batsman to score more because bowler can't look eye to eye on batsman and read mind.

India had a lot of allrounders in that era. Kind of bits and pieces players but ones who did the job. There were no passengers in the team and especially in the batting. We used to compete without a proper fast bowler abroad.Now it's a 3-4 man show abroad. We have at least 5-6 passengers in the squad despite most being specialists.

Venkat also performed well.

@TUSHAR-M: You are absolutely right in quoting a host of other names which I could not include due to space limitations. The point I was trying to make is that the present generation is unaware of the history of Cricket in India. Also there were some truly great Cricketers who never made it to the top or remained at the top. Some examples are R.B.Kenny, Abbas Ali Baig & Rungta amongst bats. Some were nosed out due to politics like Budhi Kunderan. But despite all this the old timers were great Cricketers who played the game for the love of it. The current IPL payouts has consumed the Cricketers to such an extent that players are valued more for their Money. Negi for example got a huge contract bid  but had no performance to show. So credit the greats who played & put Indian Cricket on a sound footing. Above all these were humble & modest Cricketers, which is a rare quality these days. Mr. R.Narayan's coverage is so vast that it is difficult to comment extensively on any one topic..

Fascinating stories...nice to read abt the epochal series where Indian team fought hard against the cricketing superpower of that age...I guess these are the players who laid the foundations for Indian cricket to develop. As they say, Gavaskar made Tendulkar possible, Kapil Dev make Srinath possible..

MR.Nampally, What a string of players. May I add a few other names to your list of Indian Players who did not quite shine as much as we would have liked. How about  Surti, Hanumant Singh, Saxena, Kunderan, Sardesai,Abbas Ali Baig,,Baqa Jillani Narashima Rao, Jaisimha,Doshi,A.Mankad, M. Amarnath, B. Patel Gattani, E.Solkar,C,Chauvan, Salgaonkar, Abid Ali & last but not the least Venkatraman. With the spin Quartet doing an excellent job it was equally impossible to get in the playing XI (good example of Rajinder Goel  in Delhi). As for the Windies even with new openers Greenridge & Haynes( they managed to put up a double century partnership in the very first Test in Bangalore). Credit to Tiger Pataudi & his team to come back & win the 3rd & 4th Test. Like Gundappa Vishwanath had said "" I had nothing to lose by attacking them"".Add A. Kallicharan, A. Roberts, R.Fred Fredricks & V. Richards.(all newcomers).Credit to Clive Llyod for winning the series inspite of being written off by Indians.

(Contd): Whilst Sobers totally dominated the 60's with his magnificence, the 70's belonged to several guys. In India Gavaskar & little Vishwanath with a combined height of <11 feet towered above all while Clive Lloyd with his brutal strength stood out amongst the WI bats along with their battery of Pace bowlers. But I consider the period  up to middle 70's ""the golden era of Cricket"".  Bradman to  Sobers were undoubtedly the all time greats. Indian Cricket was advanced by likes of Merchant, Hazare, Umrigar, Mankad, Gupte to likes of  Borde, Durrani, Wadekar, Jaisimha, Patuadi, Chandra & Engineer. Cricket there after, changed its colours to Professionalism - Batsmen coming out with body armour + Pitches getting covered & Cricket taken over by TV. But the old timers are the real heroes for playing Cricket in its raw form in its true spirits with little or no monetary returns. That is what I call true love for the Gentleman's sport of Cricket. Hats off to these Greats - Bravo!

Mr. Ramnarayan. If memory serves me right & just for the record the last Test Match of the series played in Bombay 1975 against Clive Llyod's team was a 6 day affair. Any idea why BCCI agreed to play the deciding last Test for 6 days and thus ended up losing the series. 
I  remember E.Solkar scoring his maiden Test century. Wonder why India was so sporting to do such a harakiri? Then after losing the Test at the new stadium in Bangalore,& the defeat in the 2nd Test in Delhi (without B.S. Bedi) his  fans were upset. The news media were predicitng a total washout & demanding  the removal of Tiger Pataudi not only as Captain but from the team itself. But India ounced back under his captaincy to win at Eden & Madras & square the series only to lose the last Test in Bombay due to the extra day. The same Windies team immediately toured Australia & were defeated 4-1 by the Ian Chappell led team of Lillee, Walker,Thomson & Pascoe. Thanks for all the memories. Keep writing about the past games.

What an article !  simply astounding -it took to me decades back - I too shared similar views of the author and experienced his similar feelings.  Am a great fan of Polly Kaka Umrigar, the one and only Gary Sobers and the mercurial Rohan Kanhai.  Umrigar never ran away from the bowling in 1952 as media reported, he shied away little with the express pace of Fred Trueman.  I recall the innings Polly played against Hall and Gilchrist in Madras in 1959 (though he scored only 4 and 29 in two innings and captain Vinoo Mankad also scored 4 in the first innings) - he bravely defended the West Indies duo of fast bowlers.  One cannot forget his 1972 not out in the West Indies in India's 1962 tour and his innings of 60 in the final Test speaks volume of his character.  In this series many reputed young batsmen shied away from the express pace bowlers of West Indies and Polly with all his experience, showed the way to handle them.  A champion player Polly - thanks for the lovely article!

A nice article by Ramnarayan on the India-Windies love affair.  No doubt the Windies were formidable force in late 50s and 60s when they had great cricketers like 3 Ws, Wes Hall, Griffith, Hunte, and of course the indomitable Gary Robers and they were invincibles at that time. But towards early 70s, they were on the decline with Sobers in his autumn of the career and their bowling weaklink saw them trounced by India in 1971 series under Ajit Wadekar's captaincy and Sunny has arrived on the international scene with top class performance with his bat scoring 700+ runs in the debut series of course our spinners headed by Erapalli Prasanna bowled well in the sub continent.  The 1974-75 saw the emergence of their heroes like Greenidge, Viv Richards and Lloyd himself in the batting and the speedsters of the yoke Andy Roberts, Julien and later on joined by Holding, Marshall and a host of 0ther speedsters. In the home series of 74-75 Gundappa Viswanath batted brilliantly in the series .

In 1960s, WI reigned supreme in test cricket.
I have a hypothesis that a world class test team should contain two world class batsmen, two  such bowlers and a great all-rounder, all in their prime, playing together.
The WI team in the mid-60s had one such combination - with Hunte/Kanhai (batsmen) , Gibbs/Hall/Griffith (bowlers) and the all-rounder nonpareil (Sobers).
The combination broke up in late 60s when Hall, Griffith and Hunte retired.
The next similar world-class team we can consider is Aus team of 2000s - with
Hayden/ Ponting (batsmen) , McGrath/Warne(bowlers). They did not have a proper all-rounder , but Gilchrist can be considered as a Wk-allrounder, and this combination was indeed formidable.
Recently SA had a combination of Smith/Amla/ ABD (batsmen). Steyn/ S Pollock (bowlers) and Kallis (all -rounder), which enabled them to become #1.
For India, if Gavaskar/Tendulkar, Kumble/Prasanna/Bedi and Kapil all played together, it would have become #1 in test rankings consistently.

Kudos for a  great summary of an unforgetable era & some of the greatest Cricketers, not easy to comment without missing some! By far the greatest of these is the tour of WI under Wadekar. The performance of Gavaskar & Sardesai in batting stood up as the best 1-2 punch by any Indian side in the Test Cricket. Gavaskar simply dominated with 774 Test runs during this tour in his Test debut. India eked out a Test series win too! No doubt he was the Finest Test opener India has ever produced. Durrani & Borde were 2 of the best All rounders most under rated but superb Cricketers. Both batted lower than they should & also could spin the ball like a Top. What can I say about the Great Polly Umrigar. I saw his superb 223 in Hyderabad Test Vs. Pakistan (I think) in late 50's. Polly was a magnificent bat albeit susceptable vs. Truman. Gary Sobers was of course the greatest Cricketer ever to grace any field with his inimitably athletic heroics which no one can perform- My #1 Cricket Hero! (Contd)

That was exactly the problem in the late 60s and 70s. Never picking ""horses for courses"". Selection flexibility is key. On a turning pitch Rajinder Goel was much more dangerous than Bishen Bedi as Bedi bowled classical left-arm orthodox by flighting the ball and Goel bowled flat and fast; however since Bedi was the superior bowler he was always picked.  If India had picked Goel in place of Bedi on turners then India might have won more. In the 50s  and till mid-60s the biggest problem was a selection incompetence issue where selectors used to pick 8-9 cricketers out of 11 from Mumbai. Mumbai was by far the best Ranji Team and 5-6 players were among the best in the country and definitely deserved to play for India. However, 2 or 3 players from Mumbai were close friends of these guys who used to get into Indian team and were not good enough for international cricket. A few deserving players from rest of India didn't get chance. A good example is Balu Gupte being chosen ahead of VV Kumar.

To win is the objective of every team,yet paramount to results were the spirit of men who represented their teams. Their dignified approach and grace was a showcase that lit the hearts of the thousands who watched them play. It was the good old days when Sir Frank Worrell and his team left an indelible  impression on the Australians decades ago. That class gradually tapered out by the early 70s. Today it's quite a contrast, the ""gentle"" from men can hardly be seen or detected. The old memories are sweet. In those days test cricket was one and far and the artists were special, not only by skills but as good ambassadors of their nation. Avin Kallicharran started his career with two centuries. Sunil Gavaskar was a sensation in the WI. Dilip Sardesai and Gundappa Vishwanauth  graceful. Over in India Clive H Lloyd scored a magnificent double hundred. Yes a lot of memories,I like to reflect and read of them.How I wish the finesse would have lasted. Today much have changed.

@JG no doubt Tredwell has been a great servant over the last couple of years, though when Australia went after him he did have no response. Also there are no real other spin options in white-ball cricket, unless one considers Briggs or Parry.
 
 
Re Bopara I actually think he has been our best limited overs bowler recently, but I wonder how conditions based that is? Also you have to remember that Bresnan usually plays, so compared to him Bopara will always look good

@Codand Chips - Think Tredwell is way above any spinner for England in shorter formats. I seem to remember the last time Parry played alongside Tredwell , Tredwell's figures were much better.
   You have to factor in conditions - Eng were reluctant to try Root so I guess they factored in what a hard job it would be with the wet ball etc - and the fact that Leask  who had already hit Ravi for 6 was on fire. For me Ravi and Tredwell (unless they hit a bad run of games) should be mainstays for their bowling in this side

@Jason Hutchinson I've had my doubts about Bell in white-ball cricket due to the lack of willingness to attack when needed. However I felt he played well yesterday, especially given the conditions. I do think Lumb is very hard done by mind and Hales could deserve a chance given his T20I stats.

I assume the squad will stay the same for Sri Lanka plus 1 or 2. Lumb was unlucky to miss out but an extra batsman would have to be more adaptable, like James Vince, so they could fill in anywhere. There's no obvious bowler to come into the squad, perhaps due to the lack of List matches.
 
 
Woakes looks like being the Jonny Bairstow of 2014, ie eternal drinks carrier and not playing any cricket before the tests. Good thing he's been released to play for Warwickshire. Personally I still don't see him as a white-ball cricketer.
 
 
Ali's role confuses me. He rarely bowled in his previous matches and didn't exactly showcase his batting, so still selecting him when somebody like Lumb is left out is bizarre.

@CodandChips I totally agree with respect to the Hampshire attack, especially if you're running with Balcombe who for me has never really set the game alight.  I'm not a fan of that approach and it will be interesting to see if it persists throughout the season. That said, I guess if you're committed to using upper order players the likes of JV, Liam and Slug for a significant number of overs you can take the risk, but when you don't know if Slug will turn in 25 overs at 3s or 5s it can be a big risk, and Liam on a bad day isn't a joy to watch.  
 
 
Yeah, you're right, JV continues to impress.  Those ground shots are delightful and, as I've said before, never mind comparing him to Vaughan, his classy style is more of a right handed Gower.

No complaints here, I'm just glad we got a game in. Credit to the umpires and both sets of players, this made for an entertaining listen.

I doubt England has learned very much from that game. I presume they haven't got Ballance in the side to be a #7 batsman. Gurney did well and has to be an improvement on Dernbach, but that was about it.

Totally agreeing with yorkshire-86.  The hard cold fact is both those players missed last week's matches to do little all week and then bowl 4 overs today.  One could half reasonably argue that missing a round if CC matches then will reduce risk of 'burnout' late summer.  But to then deny CC cricket starting this Sunday is absurd!  Given we don't play SL until the 20th May.  These two ( and Jimmy who probably won't play the T20), will have had no decent match practice in more challenging cricket since late April!

What planet are England on?

You can't take out more than you put in so I think this game is an important test of where Englands mentality is really at. ..

There is a heads must roll brigade which want to use any single match to despatch certain players. Stephen Westmoreland is no exception. 'No excuses'. But there are actually. Batting in Scotland as far North as Aberdeen in May is as dicey as it gets. It will all be a bit of a lottery for both sides, but you fancy the local side will have an advantage. Of course England ought to win. But to think of a single game in May being a decider of careers is plainly nonsensical. If the pitch is tricky, the match will be tricky, players aren't supermen. It will be a great leveller and could lead to an exciting game. What is wrong with that? Giles got the push because his side were beaten by Holland in a dead rubber? Is that how the ECB works now? Funny that the batting coach's role was never brought into question though. We are told Thorpe is in line to replace Gooch.

It is always better choice not to play IPL as it kind if helps the modern day cricketers to concentrate more on test match cricket. in case a country has an entirely different team for T20, they can probably play IPL or any T20 games for that matter. I see guys like Cook, Root, Siddle, Phil Hughes playing county in England. It certainly helps them to be in order for Test commiments coming up. Very few modern players have the capacity to adopt to all formats of the game very quickly namely, Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers. So i dont think people have got much to worry abt the fact that English players are not playing IPL or big bash.

Some very funny ideas here.  Particularly the nothing to gain everything to lose perspective, well, so what?  All teams have to play matches like this at times, if England show up without actually 'showing up'  and they lose then it just 'shows them up' for what they are.  Conversely if they thrash the Scots then most people will yawn and go back to their corners, what else would you expect, MBE's?
 
 
Also people talking of finished careers for two of Englands best players, neither of whom are even 30 years old.. why the drama?  My goodness it is indeed little wonder English cricket is in such a state.
 
 
At the end of the day this is about Scottish cricket and they've earned these rare opportunities by fighting their way to the WC next year.  When you look through the list of teams they've had to get past to arrive at this point you'd have to say they are deserving of these matches. Good on the ECB for throwing them a few crumbs, needs to be more but it's a step in the right direction.

Thirimanne's 10 runs from 37 balls in the 2nd ODI vs England just isn't quick enough and leaves SL 20 runs short. Kusal is a better open to open the innings with Dilshan. Even if he fails it's at a run a ball or better and if he stays in for 10 overs plus SL wins.

@Lenard Fernardo. I am not comparing Tharanga, Vithanage or Kusal, just noting Tharanga's crucial ODI innings vs Ireland and Kithuruwan's T20 blitz (52 off 24 balls) vs Sussex. And noting that neither Tharanga nor promising Kithuruwan are in the current ODI squad, and Kusal is. This leaves only an under-performing Kusal as a selection option to open with Dilshan, which would allow Thirimanne to drop to 3. Why Tharanga with his impressive England record was not selected for the England tour (only for Ireland ODIs) especially after 2 centuries for SL A vs England Lions, and why he was dropped from SLs ODI and Test teams in the first place are the key questions. I watched his excellent 149 for SL A vs England Lions in the 3rd Test at the Premadasa in February.
The selectors should recall Tharanga for both home series vs South Africa in July and Pakistan in August (4 Tests and 6 ODIs in total) and give the SL A  captaincy for the mid-July tour of England to someone else.

@FawltyBean: Good...  who needs experience or skills.! In the near future, Reality will strike with a Bang, when it appears in Practical Terms.!! Don't worry pal, Tharanga wouldn't be even considered for a place in the squad, as usual. I have posted my opinion to the broadminded SL cricket fans, who are capable to understand simple logic.

@Compton-Effect - We don't thankfully need anyone to partner with Dilshan for Tests. Dilshan retired from tests last year to concentrate on ODI's and T20 leagues around the world.

When you think about the upcoming Test series in Eng, the obvious question is, do we have any opener with experience to partner Dilshan in those conditions? We have Kaushal Silva, who is new. Although, Tharanga had been given just 15 Tests, he had accumulated 713 Test Runs, Averaging 28.52 , 165 HS + 3 x 50+ scores during that short period in Test format.   
 
 
When you consider his ability to stay at the wicket, in any condition, and his recent performances in SL-A, I think Tharanga is a worthwhile option to try out in Tests too, especially in England. 
 
 
His unique record of long partnerships in ODIs, is a Golden Testimony for his ability to stay at the wicket to play a long inning. Which is the prime factor required from a Test batsmen.
 
 
Upul Tharanga is holding the WORLD-RECORD for the MOST number of 200+ PARTNERSHIPS in ODI. He has involved SEVEN times in 200+ PARTNERSHIPS  for SL!. The only other player in the world, who has equaled this World Record, is Aussie player Ricky Ponting

@nickexplore: 
Why are you trying to compare a player like Upul tharanga with such an exceptional track record (spreading over 5000+ ODI runs) with Kithuruwa & Kusal? Remember, this Thranga boy had scored 13 big CENTURIES & 28 Fifty plus scores for SL, in every corner of the world, handling BOUNCE,SEAM, PACE & SPIN equally well.! It seems you don't properly understand what is cricket. In Ireland he had to play the anchor role withstanding that hostile seam bowling, when Kusal vanished within 4 balls and the 2nd wicket also fell pretty quickly. If not for his valuable contribution of being there until the end of hostile morning session, with 24 runs, SL may have lost that ODI to Ireland. Tharanga accomplished what an opener suppose to do in ODIs. This format is entirely different from T20, where you may whack as you wish, since there are 11 players to share the bite in that short spell of 20 overs! 
",Positive
"
 
If Upul Tharanga was in SLs ODI squad I bet he would be selected to open in the 2nd ODI (averages 33.88 with a 174*). Likewise Kithuruwan Vithanage, whose 52* off 24 balls in the T20 vs Sussex  showed just how explosive he can be. Kusal Janith certainly has competition for his spot. If Kusal could just stay in for 10-15 overs, SL would win everytime because he scores so quickly. I know he has licence to attack from the outset but his success rate is just too low. Maybe Tharanga will be recalled for the series against South Africa in SL in July, in which case Sri Lanka A will need a new captain for their England tour.

I prefer the same team to play next 2 matches and see. Then bring changes. This is the best 11 for WC in NZ/AU. Hope SL will improve in the next match.

Neither Upul Tharanga (24 off 52 balls vs Ireland) nor Kithuruwan Vithanage are in SLs current ODI squad, so the selectors will probably recall Kusal Perera for the 2nd ODI vs England to open with Dilshan and put Thirimanne at 3. Ashan Priyanjan and Chathuranga de Silva provide the selectors with middle-order options should Chandimal and others continue to under-perform, while Ajantha Mendis gives the team the x-factor missing from the bowling attack in the 1st ODI.

Sri Lanka would have given a better show if both teams batted in the same weather conditions.That is natural after the rain ,fast bowlers have very big advantage due to the moisture in the air.Nothing wrong with Sri Lankans.They will come up in second game with adjust to the england conditions.I hope SL should try Upul Thranga to open with Dilshan.One of the openers should play a long game.

Well...Sri Lanka is not like other countries...try the short ball again with Sri Lanakans and England will regret trying....SL is not scared of the short ball...only thing was the condition suited well for England on Thursday. Sri Lanka did have a bad day in the office..i did not see any player focusing what they had to do. just threw their wickets away. Do not get excited they will bounce back and I'm sure of it. just a little sun needed and they will be fine...SL won a one day series in Australia..and the last limited over games played in South Africa they chased more than 300 runs and won both games...so this is nothing for them...i feel England does not have a good bowling unit...

Really woeful batting display by Sri Lnakan  whats going wrong ? there is senior & junior mix up with batting line up but all are not consistent we need good opening partnership then only we can win the remaining matches so try with Tharanga as a opener with dilshan or vithanage all the best next match

Kusal does not have the technique for English or Australian pitches - The selectors should consider CHAMARA KAPUGEDERA and BHANUKA RAJAPAKSHE , both of whom are explosive players and can bowl a few overs .

I think the weather did not help the SL at all. It was difficult match to win at least our guys should try to get the condition by batting sensibly which they did not do will might have impact on future matches well. If Kusal is going play next world cup he should be opening regardless of warming up match results. Kusal job is get 25 - 30 runs in 1-5 overs that help the down to order take their time to adjust to the condition and bat long innings. That has been our strategy and should continue same.

Those clamouring for Upul Tharanga's inclusion in SLs Test and ODI teams certainly have a point and the compelling statistics to back it up. Tharanga scored two centuries for Sri Lanka against the England Lions in February: 116 at Dambulla and an impressive 149 at the Premadasa. He has not been forgotten by the selectors though, as he is captain of SL A for their England tour in mid-July. If he again does well, he may well be recalled to play Tests and ODIs against Pakistan in SL in August. Then maybe a place for Tharanga in SLs World Cup squad, especially as Kusal Perera is not convincing the selectors at the moment. As for the Tests, Kaushal Silva and Dimuth Karunaratne are the selectors first choice openers, but Tharanga is well in the reckoning.

1st ODI showed again, the VALUE of MISSING EXPERIENCE at The TOP!  SL missing the services of a stable, EXPERIENCED OPENER, who can stem the side and play a long inning in these conditions! Opener should be able to stay there, until the middle order is exposed (min. 25 ov), while Dilshan is making the initial impact from one end. Otherwise, its going to be a real burden for others in front/middleorder, as repeatedly seen during the past 10 months! Middle order cannot handle this pressure as they did in subcontinent The only SL opener who can prevent this is Tharanga. His track record proves it!

Yet another woeful batting display. Sanga's shot was a terrible cross bat shot played away from the body.The top order is brittle with nothing to fall back on unlike in earlier times.Why on earth don't they play Kaushal Silva as an opening bat in the 50 over format? He is a batsman with a solid technique and a brilliant fielder.
His career will be ruined by playing him in only tests which are few and far between. Sidat Wettimuni was ruined by this approach.As for the bowling they don't know how to change when the going got tough- continued bowling in the slot
when they should have bowled the rising ball at face & chest height

@cricfan100 totally agree with you. Chandimal will only deliver once in a blue moon batting at no.6. By nature, he is best placed at no.4, which is stubornly occupied by out of form Mahela. Chandimal's avg at no.3 and 4 is miles higher than his career avg, which was devastated by management demoting him down to no.6. It has ruined his confidence, and may end up ruining his career if they keep him there...

I think this is a very timely article. Lot of fans here have pointed out that we shouldn't read much into this based on one bad performance. But these weaknesses in the batting department have been there for last couple of years, somehow they were covered up because we were winning due to excellent bowling and ground fielding. Sangakkara and mahela should have moved down the order long time ago. Giving number three to either thiri or chandi, which never happened. Chandimal' s batting style doesn't suit his batting position at all. He could be an excellent no 3 batsman but he is not a good no:6. Either you play him top of the order or you don't play him at all. 
To be frank kusal has been more consistent than mahela in the shorter format in the recent past. Mahela scored his first ODI 50 after a good year and half in the last Asia cup final. And you don't know how long it will take him to score the next. When the great mahela himself is inconsistent why so much talk  about kusal.

I still believe that SL should have added Upul Tharanga at least in the squad, if not in the playing XI. This gives the back up option of having a condition known opener. ..... The other thing is, SL should give all the players a chance to play at least a game in these alien conditions in the process of preparation for WC 2015, without considering much of the out come of the games. ..... Selectors also should emphasize that Kusal's role is not just hitting run a ball 10-15 and getting out, he should be able to perform consistently without worrying of being Jayasuriya. .... !

In bowling even Isuru Udana managed to bowl averagely faster than the contemporary Malinga. Even if he can be made to listen to Vass or Pillock (at the Mumbai Indians), he does not seem to have the noodle to absorb advice. Lakmal is better material to work with since he has some pace. Kula is sadly just an also-ran (albeit slowly) and his away swinger just a myth. On true pitches with reasonable pace and bounce SL's magic men are just bad street conjurers.

Once again, we have the fair weather SL supporters looking for changes after one game. Nobody, including Andrew Fernando, saw slowing reflexes when Dilshan batted in the T20 International. Thirimanne got a good ball, as did Sangakkara. Kusal Perera does not at this stage, have the technique and shot selection to open the innings in England. Vithanage is promising, but one swallow does not a summer make. If the team is going to be selected on one game performances, we will have chaos, not teamwork. The match was lost in the last ten overs of England's innings. Changes may be needed because of pitch conditions, but, not on the basis of one game performances.

Why SL desperately need an experienced Opener?  In addition to the posting I sent just now, here are some more facts to prove our best option's current batting form: Tharang has steadily maintained his batting form to date, with Two recent Centuries against Eng-A side (two months ago) and Centuries in recent domestic games plus 24 valuable runs in the solitary ODI given in Ireland last week, withstanding a hostile attack of seam bowling in a spring morning session. Worthwhile reminding, just before he was dropped from the national side, Tharanga had scored an unbeaten 174* on an extremely Bouncy fast track, in Kingston, WI July 2013. His ODI  form at that point, (most recent 12 months) July 2012 to the day he was dropped in Aug 2013, Tharanga had played 20 ODIs - 2 n/o,  & accumulated 567 Runs at an Av 31.5 at home & away on lively decks! Therefore, there is no issue at all, with his current form. Please read my previous posting for some interesting performance Stats on fast -decks.

As I have said many times before, without an experienced OPENER, SL will constantly have a massive problem in ODIs outside subcontinent!  Among the current players, Tharanga is the most Experienced, most Consistent Opening Batsmen to tackle the conditions that we saw today in Eng. He holds the Highest Batting Average (69.4) in Eng for a SL player. He has the HIGHEST overall Batting Average (34.5) for a SL player in countries (Eng, Aus, WI, SA, NZ ) on Seaming, Bouncy Fast- Decks! He had played 51 innings, scoring 1687 Runs (with 2 N/O) maintaining almost 35 runs per inning Average!

The SL selectors usually get it pretty right, but this time the decision to leave out both explosive openers Kithuruwan and Kusal backfired badly.

Three seniors are slow to react these days. When Sri Lanka won 9 games in-a-row luckily Mahela and Dilshan were out injured at one time or another, so youngsters got the chance to play.

This match was a total failure. Bowling changes weren't up to standards - Malinga and Kulasekara were being put into bowl when they were going for runs. [There are some people here, who we didn't see when Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup and World Cup, saying that 'the so called best death overs bowler went for runs'; even the best bowlers in the world can have bad days!!! Kusal slapped Steyn all round the ground for 17 runs an over in the WC but that doesn't mean Steyn is not class?!?!

However, this is only the first match of five and let's see how we do in the next few. This is a good wake up call for our guys and shows that you can't keep winning everyday - you will lose a match someday. Hope the rain keeps away and our boys come back with a bang after this joke of a match.

Why do some people still say that Chandimal should've been dropped? He is one of our best batsmen on these fast, bouncy tracks and you want him to be dropped?? He has always done well in ENG, and he even performed well against IRE, and in the warm-ups when he was forced to bat at No. 7!! If this match was in the SC, I, too, would doubt his place in the XI because he's pretty average in Asia. Moreover, he is constantly being pushed down the order and forced to slog at Nos. 6 or 7!
Why can't the management see that Thiri is not an opener, especially in these conditions (though they had no choice here 'cause Kusal has been woeful), and Chandi cannot bat below No. 5?? Let Thiri and Chandi play in the top 5 and make the seniors bat around them or have them in the XI on a rotational basis. The seniors automatically get the Nos. 3 and 4, take ages to settle down (Dilshan isn't any better), put pressure on the inexperienced youngsters and take up youngsters' places while they're at it!

@JG2704& @ CnC: to my mind, Carberry's a sht-format player. I was surprised with his elevation to Test status in Aus. I think he has this ODI series v SL to show his stuff and if it isn't forthcoming, then Eng must move on. His evident fallibility in the field (despite his aggressive ground fielding) has to be a factor, esp. at the Test level. Jordan has as good as been told that he'll be playing TC v soon, so he must start at Lord's. I suspect that Broad will not be ready, so that suggests that he, Jimmy & Bres will play. There is likely to be a 4th seamer in the absence of a frontline spinner: Gurney may be considered, being left arm  - a variation that Moores rates (while Finn is a masterpiece in progress). Spin will have to come from two part-timers: Ali & Root, with Ali the better of the two, IMO. As for w/k, CnC, I deeply regret the recent thinking that the w/k has to be a poss ton scorer. One of the joys of watching TC shd be seeing a top w/k at work. We have two: Foster & Read.

Disappointed by SL performance. Jordan was not lethal and Tredwell was so one-dimensional in their bowling. SL lost the match that they should have won. Chandimal, Matthews and Kulasekara threw away their wickets. Hope they play better rest of the series.

Sri Lankans play a great fascinating exciting brand of cricket. I just cannot describe the entertainment. Easily the most exciting team in world cricket after Australia is Sri Lanka. Australia is exciting in test cricket, but in both other formats, definitely Sri Lanka are the most exciting. They added so many new dimensions to cricket such as the first 15 over blitz as pioneered by Jayasuriya and Kaluwitharana to dil scoop followed by worldclass fielding and the list never ends. Looking forward to an exciting game on Sunday in Durham.

One swallow (a welcome win against under-performing opponents) doesn't make a summer, but it's a win with a couple of plusses attached. England's problem is that too many of the squad are effective county cricketers yet to demonstrate they can make the transition to international cricket, but they have to start somewhere.
At the opposite end, Tredwell and Bopara are presumably still playing with the World Cup in mind. Surely they are not the future of England cricket and if persisted with for too long might hold back that future. If we don't develop better options within eighteen months or so, the team will still be struggling.

@dunger.bob I'm surprised by your reaction because I thought he looked very uncomfortable when playing in Australia
 
 
Re Taylor perhaps I'm building him up to be a world beater purely because he has an excellent domestic record but is not the side, at the side hasn't had much success in recent times.As is inevitable with all young players they do get built up to be something which they aren't, but hopefully Taylor can rise to the expectations.
 
 
@JG2704 Tredwell is the best white-ball spinner we have (unless you count Bopara as a spinner). Though nonetheless some of his recent performances have worried me. Hopefully it's nothing. Briggs and Parry can perhaps consider themselves hard done by, but Tredwell is the best option. Graeme White had a good FLT20 last season, so maybe an eye should be kept on him.
 
 
Re the test spinner, I'd pick Kerrigan as a front-line, or go with 4 front-line seamers plus Borthwick. Yes he bowls dross but takes wickets, and can bat.

Before the match this actually looked like quite a well balanced side, and the emergence of Ballance at 3 and an aggressive hitting fast bowler in the name of Jordan, combined with playing Root where he should have been for the last 12 months, to me seems that Moores might move us in the right direction. Plus a bowling attack that stood out for its variety. Moores will inevitably be tempted to play Stokes instead of Bopara or Gurney, but unless Stokes can prove he can bowl tightly enough and not leak runs he shouldnt be in the side. Oh yeah, and where do you play Broad?!

Understand the rain interruptions, but then, its not like a full length game.   We always make room for Chandimal and we loose all the time. Thank God, sanity prevailed in the T20 world cup to keep him out. Thirimanne shouldn't have opened. he is a no. 5,6 bat. We had a choice, either Kusal or Tharanga, but both were left out. cannot understand the selection. Chandimal doesn't deserve a place in the team.

@Nutcutlet on (May 23, 2014, 9:39 GMT) It's a conundrum. Do you think Carberry's days are over? 
   I'm not saying he should play but he seemed to indicate that he was told he still figured?
   I aways said I thought Swann would be a biggesr loss than KP and I stand by that. I wonder if they'll go for a batsman who can bowl a bit of spin - Patel,Borthwick,Ali or whether they go for a spinner. It seems the main men vying for that spot - Monty and Kerrigan add very little with the bat. Something tells me they'll go without a frontline spinner as we have a defensive mindset and Monty and Kerrigan maybe aren't seen to be consistent enough to merrit a place with ball alone. 
   Think they're more likely to go with one of the JBs - regardless of keeping ability - than go for one of the 2 veterans.
    Jordan over Bres and Stokes may weaken the batting a bit more but I feel Eng would gain more from what he'd add to the bowling than lose from his batting comp to the other 2

@Codandchips - Still think Tredwell is by far the best SF spin option we have. Most country's spinners go for runs at some point with the exception of Narine and to a degree one or 2 others. Also re the T20 game
 
 
 Whatever way you look at it re the dropped catch , both players must have a degree of blame attached to them. If Carberry called he should maybe have caught it (even with Morgan's presence) but Morgan would be to blame for not backing away. If neither called it was a poor show all round.

@Blade-Runner- I don't agree with you. Age is not the factor lowering Dilshan's strike rate, it is the added responsibility as a senior batsman. So now he is looking to bat through the innings instead of going all guns blazing and losing his wicket. In addition to this we can't blame the team for sticking with their plans that worked superbly in the past games. Also we can't always rely on Kusal Perera to provide a good start. If he struggles for a short period he most likely gets out. But he has the talent and I hope he would adapt to such situations and do well in the future.

SL is looking with so called seniors in the side. Let them retire and lets lose giving some opportunity for new guys. If so it will be an investment for future but now we lose and no point in losing.

Why SL desperately need an experienced Opener? In addition to the posting I sent just now, here are some more facts to prove our best option's current batting form: Tharang has steadily maintained his batting form to date, with Two recent Centuries against Eng-A side (two months ago) and Centuries in recent domestic games plus 24 valuable runs in the solitary ODI given in Ireland last week, withstanding a hostile attack of seam bowling in a spring morning session. Worthwhile reminding, just before he was dropped from the national side, Tharanga had scored an unbeaten 174* on an extremely Bouncy fast track, in Kingston, WI July 2013. His ODI form at that point, (most recent 12 months) July 2012 to the day he was dropped in Aug 2013, Tharanga had played 20 ODIs - 2 n/o, & accumulated 567 Runs at an Av 31.5 at home & away on lively decks! Therefore, there is no issue at all, with his current form. Please read my previous posting for some interesting performance Stats on fast -decks.
",Positive

As I have said many times before, without an experienced OPENER, SL will constantly have a massive problem in ODIs outside subcontinent! Among the current players, Tharanga is the most Experienced, most Consistent Opening Batsmen to tackle the conditions that we saw today in Eng. He holds the Highest Batting Average (69.4) in Eng for a SL player. He has the HIGHEST overall Batting Average (34.5) for a SL player in countries (Eng, Aus, WI, SA, NZ ) on Seaming, Bouncy Fast- Decks! He had played 51 innings, scoring 1687 Runs (with 2 N/O) maintaining almost 35 runs per inning Average!

I don't see many mentions of Gurney.    I live in the US, and therefore I dont really keep in touch with County Cricket.     The T20 on Tuesday and yesterday's ODI were the first time I have seen him, and I have to say, he impressed me on both occasions.

My team played to understand where they are sitting right now. No doubt they need to improve in all departments. Give these 11 another 2 matches then selectors can think making changes. I think we need 3 fast bowlers and 1 spinner for NZ/AU WC. Rangana might be a better bowler than Sachithra in NZ/AU. We also need Tissara to improve the length. - Best wishes for the Next Match from NorthRydeGilMart

@Eppingjagoris Agree with you. The seniors are only hurting, not helping. The T20 proved that SL do not need Sanga and Mahela anymore. Not only are they sidelining youngsters and neglecting them international exposure, they are also preventing them from batting in their comfort zones. Chandimal is practically incapable of scoring while batting below no.5, while Thirimanne is only at his best in no.3. Neither of them are pinchhitters, both are strokeplayers. Why puzzle over whether to play Chandi, KJP or Priyanjan, when you could drop two seniors and play all three. Play the seniors on a rotation policy; one of them at a time, it will benefit SL...

@dunger.bob final comment
 
 
Cook and Bell are both test regulars. Therefore you'd expect them to be missing a lot of ODI games through being rested. Surely then they should be ignored for ODIs, and the squad selected should be one that can be stuck with for a period of time.
 
 
Also another serious consideration is rain-affected matches. If you have too many plodders in your team who are unable to raise the tempo, if the match gets shortened they become ineffective. Having somebody that can both bat through and clear the ropes solves this problem

@dunger.bob (continued) Taylor scored a 77 ball hundred against my beloved Hants. Taylor's county record is similar to Ballance's, which suggests he can bat through as well. But he is inexperienced.
 
 
Ballance played well yesterday so he could play in that top 3 instead of Taylor. He however struggled to raise the tempo when needed, despite being billed as a destructive player. The advantage of Taylor would also be he is a much better fielder. 
 
 
But I certainly feel that you need a steady batsman. ODIs are not an elongated T20. 
 
 
I am being harsh on Bell given he averages 50 in recent times and has scored reasonably quickly. But it does not inspire me with confidence when he is batting for too long.

In Lumb and Taylor, I've mentioned 2 guys who I believe capable of batting through and clearing the ropes later on.

James Taylor has an excellent county record in all formats, so would be capable of batting through, then clearing the ropes easily. (continued)

Well, there is no need of jumping to conclusions coz it was just the 1st match and there are 4 more to be played. Anyway, Sri Lanka had a woeful day yesterday in all departments. Sometimes it happens. Nevertheless, I thought that SL bowlers went overboard with those slower balls. At one point, It became so predictable that England batsmen were camping on backfoot waiting for those slower stuff. And with all due respect to Dilshan (has been a great servant of SL cricket ) its so apparent that the age is catching up with him. We can't expect him to be that dashing batsman he used to be. But he is still good in the opening slot to hold line from one end but can't be expected to give those blistering starts so regularly. So we must persist with Kusal. I hope we will come back strong on Sunday to even the series 1-1. Go Sri Lanka !!!!

I don't agree that the shortened game favoured England at all. The second rain break may have benefitted them slightly more than it did Sri Lanka but only because they were already well ahead in the game by then. I actually thought the longer break would suit Sri Lanka, as England were already well placed at 102-2 to make a more than challenging total in a full 50 overs, but then had to come back out and try and set whatever they felt would be a competitive total in 39 overs, which they did in the end but only after Jordan gave the innings some impetus in the last three overs

Clearly, Chris Jordan is going to play Test cricket. The more interesting question is where he will fit in. Is he going to be England's 4th seamer after Jimmy, Stuart Broad (when fit) and Tim Bresnan? Does his front-runner status now reduce the chances of Woakes? What about Stokes (when fit)? For what it's worth, this would be my team for Lord's next month: Cook, Ali, Bell, Root, Ballance, Stokes (?), Bopara, Foster/ Read (let's have a proper w/k for a change!), Bresnan, Jordan and Anderson. If Stokes and Bopara taken together are regarded as too much of a good thing, then James Taylor should play in place of one of them. Up for discussion.

SL should have tried the same squad of T 20 (With Lot of Young Talent) allowing Sanga and Mahela to take part of series later.Whole team of T 20 were on rampage to demolish English attack.Though it is different format of the game should have retained YOUNG BLOOD to prove their talent in a different format of game.
Out come of first 50 over game I see as failure of replacing players who are not in form though they r senior.It os natural.Can not blame players.But selectors should have thought the best way of dealing with game.Hope this is a eye opener for them.GOOD LUCK SL .I am great SL supporter from Sydney

@ CodandChips: Your team for the 2015 WC looks to have a bit more zing in it than the current lot. Cook and Bell are both a bit uncomfortable in l.o cricket because they're both grinders. Bell can go a bit I suppose but it's not really Cooks natural game from what I've seen. On the other hand there are definitely times when guys like that are a godsend. 50 overs can be a very long time if you lose too many early wickets. In the six you named Root is an obvious one who could play that role but I can't see another one there. .. not that I know much about English cricket mind you. And I could be wrong about needing a few steadier batsmen as well.

The big 3 seem to have used up  all their glory days, I don't think they would actually benefit SL much from here on. SL should rebuild their team using young and promising talents. Future squads should look like this:
1. KJP 2. Munaweera 3. Thiri 4. Chandi 5. Ashan 6. Tharanga 7. Mathews 8. Kula 9. Sena 10. Slinga 11. Dananjaya extras: Thisara, Maharoof, de Silva, Tharindu Kaushal, Vithanage......................
Chandimal and Thirimanne's failures have mostly come when they bat out od their comfort zones. Munaweera is a genuine opener, Priyanjan brings solidity to the middle order, Tharanga's swinging ball weakness can be neautralised if he bats in the middle order, and Mathews and the tail can end the innings with a flourish. Oh, and SL's loss in the first ODI may be a blessing in disguise. Having won so many recent matches, some of the players may have become a bit overconfident. So a harsh slap of reality was needed, and they got it via some brilliance from Jordan and England.....

Good on England. But it shouldn't get too excited given the influence of the weather. For me England's middle order still looks fragile. Isnt it better to leave out Morgan, who can never rescue England when needed, and bring in Notts' Patel. He provides left arm spin option to strengyhen the bowling dept and is presently more dependable than Morgan as a batsman.

I have been saying for sometime that Allistair Cook is a specialist test batsman and he is not a limited over player . England become No1 in test when Allastair Cook played only test cricket . My strong recommendation is that Allasatair Cook should only play Test Cricket and I am certain both himself and England will return to the top in test cricket. It was Peterson , Bell and Cook who batten England to the top in Test Cricket, but Bell and Peterson did well once Cook laid the foundation and Anderson and Broad had more runs to defend . So Please Selectors lest return Cook to test cricket only and he will regain his form. He should a be relived of the captaincy . The  WI Selectors finally listen to me and have replaced the Sammy the Passenger with Ramdin as Captain which means the WI can now play to full strength . For England The problem was never Peterson  English Cricket began to fail when Cook was given the captaincy and began playing limited overs he lost his patience in batting

Opening slot for SL: why not try a specialist opener? Cook is no dasher but is a solid batter. If Dilly cannot connect with the scoop, and cannot hit a six if Tuan Mohamed's life depends on it - what is the reason for keeping him in this pivotal slot? Kusal has a hundred million miles to go before he can become a Sanath. What happened to Dilshan Munaweera, to Akila Dananjaya and to all those promising youngsters like Bhanuka? Is it politics, the old school-tie or just willful blindness? SL would be world champs if we were not our own worst enemy. Money makes the world go round so I do not hope for much better. Angelo must be given the freedom to rebuild the side in his own time and with some freedom to make mistakes without those old creaking limbs of D,S & M and N & LM hampering his burgeoning style. If he fails, so be it, but at least he would have had a fair go. Be ruthless as Mahela was with Marvan in 2007. Cut the jetsam adrift and WIN. If you lose, lose with respect and dignity.

Root did ok. He struggled to get going initially. I do believe he is not a natural finisher, though can do the job- his first few ODIs in India, New Zealand and the Champions trophy he was averaging 50 at a very healthy strike rate. Though perhaps he'd be better suited in the top 3.
 
 
So there are many top 3 options. As I've said, I'd rather not Cook and Bell because you don't really want them batting for too long. Lumb and Taylor are my preferred choices. Hales or Vince opening is attractive. Both can score quickly. If Hales were to bat as he does in T20Is, and we agree not to get angry if he gets out early, would be very useful. Averaging 35 is better than many in ODIs. And he'd get an extended powerplay, and more overs vs seam. Vince as a posible alternative scores qucikly playing proper shots, and can bat through while scoring quickly. Though I'd try Hales in Australia, which would allow Root at 4.

Sri Lanka should stick to their brand of cricket rather than thinking too much about conditions. Kusal should open the batting and big three should take responsibility if they really want to play 2015 or leave with respectfully allowing youngsters like Vithanage, Kausal Silva to play . Secondly if the wicket is good and sun is out always batting first is the best choice. Lately SL won more matches defending the totals. Loss is a loss but nothing to worry too much. This is the first ODI loss in this year anyway. Its amazing all the Indian stat gurus and pundits come out when ever Sri Lanka loose and SL fans need not to go after them because we all know their capabilities lately in overseas.

@ Andrew-Schulz true India had a bad overseas test record since 2011 but i don't remember Sri Lanka setting the world on fire in away tests in recent history...n how do u claim that Sri Lanka's 1-0 victory to be far more impressive than India's when India won the 1st test by 10 wickets n almost won the 3rd test indian bowlers couldn't clean out the tail......n if ur going 15 to 20 years back to justify that sri lanka has a good overseas record it tells us the story that Sri Lanka typically like any other sub continent team has a poor away record..

The fresh faces in the England team played top ODI cricket. They gave an iota for death specialist Malinga and the 2 SL batting legends. SL  needed a good start but were let down. In spite of Kusal Perera's many failures I still think he should open. There are 5 ODI's and he is bound to come good in at least 2 or 3. I'm afraid Legends Sangakarra and Jayawardene caved in badly. Mahela as always plays delicate, elegant strokes, but has no power. The SL team need fresh faces (Like England did) They should be bold and include Vithanage and Kusal.  Even Chandimal's position must be considered (again) There are 5 matches and it wouldn't hurt to drop him and select Chatarunga de Silva or Priyanjan now and then. At least they will have an extra bowling option.

Dhoni48, SL haven't won a single Test where? New Zealand and England?  They certainly have.  Their 1-0 win in NZ IN 1995 was far more impressive than India's in 2009.

Just a bad day in office for Sri Lanka. England certainly the better team and richly deserve to win. Excellent performance, but they are professional enough to understand that Sri Lanka can bounce back very hard. The Lankans are quick learners. It is appalling to note that the think tank forced Thirimanne to open, to make room for Chandimal. I am not barking at Chandimal, the truth hurts though, but is Chandimal turning out to be  a stroke less, non scoring  wonder ?

Good luck for the next game boys. Bad luck yesterday. Bring in Shaminda Eranga if he is in the ODI squad. He will do well in these conditions. Also open with Kusal and Thiri.

High time for 3 sticky footed, reckless hitting seniors to retire, they can do nothing in 2015 WC on those Australian pitches. The S'tors should know, Country's future is more important than the future of the 3, 3 should have been dropped long time ago soon after their sorry performances in Z'bwe Nov08 & B'desh Jan 09, the career stats of the 3 shows,times when  they had failed 15-25 at a stretch(stats Cricinfo) particularly on foreign soil. Incidentally the Country's fans are made to suffer due to the deliberate intention of S'tors to bring Ajantha's (only SLan to take 4, 6-wkt hauls in LOs)self-confidence-gained under Mahela, to zero level, to make way for a henchman (left-arm) afterMurali's  retirement,thus Ajantha was always asked to bowl@ wrong times when the batters were fully set.

Bopara's innings / stats are very deceiving - in the last T20, he was scoring way too slowly, and then at the end when it was too late and the game was lost, he swung a couple of sixes - this is classic Ravi, playing for your averages before you play for the team.

Sri Lanka are overrated. They look great when the ball is not moving and pitch is low but on lively pitches especially in England where the ball moves about they look clueless and pathetic.

It showed yet again, the VALUE of the MISSING EXPERIENCE at The TOP!  SL missing the services of a stable, experienced opener, who can stem the side and play a long inning in these conditions! Opener should be able to stay there, until the middle order is exposed (min. 25 ov), while Dilshan is making the initial impact from the other end. Otherwise, its going to be a real burden for others in front/middleorder, as repeatedly seen during the past 10 months! Middle order cannot handle this pressure as they did in subcontinent The only SL opener who can prevent this is Tharanga. His track record proves it! Tharanga was the Main Architect of 5-0 rubbing in 2006, His average stay at the wicket is 26.2 Overs! He had the highest Batting Average 69.4 with 2 x100s 
120 R - 76.92S/R  v Eng-Lord's(Thar 48.4 ov)

Losing is a part of the game though SL does not play to lose.  SL crowds and the players understand this.  That is why their smiles are eternal.

Nice to see everyone's talking about the game and players involved rather than going off in silly tangents about teams not involved in the game.

    From the scorecard it looks like everyone contributed but why not keep Bopara at 7 where he has been doing better?

Winning one match in the cold rainy weather won't make England a better team than Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka ruled the world in T20..

Sri Lanka was also OD world champions in 1996 and reached the finals and semi-finals on several occasions in recent years. Only Sri Lankan and Australians are consistent performers in the world cup. England has never even won the world cup???  I can never see England ever reaching the quarter finals.Talking about test match is there anyone in the England team like Sangagara or Jeyawaderna?

SL came with a Test team.  There has to be a few aggressive hitters in any ODI team, SL had none for the day. Dilshan can still motor on, but he isn't the fearful player he was. Sangakarra cant really force the pace, while Mahela plays deft, gentle, strokes with no power. Both are essentially Test players  as is Thirimanne. The rest (barring Thissera P) can't get an ODI scoreboard rattling. England on the other hand have unearthed and unlike SL are unafraid to include newcomers like Jordan, Balance, Buttler, and Hales (Didn't play). And then there is Bopara. When England got 247 at 6.33 it was 'game over'

@yorkshire86 - I agree that Ali is by no means the finished article as a bowler but the fact is that we don't have a world class spinner orang thing close. I'd dispute that ""most games are decided by spin"" and I believe that Ali and Root between them can cover at least 10 overs and both are young enough to improve. The fact that both can bat well too - Ali needs a proper run in the side before you can really judge him as he's done ok to-date - and provide good enough cover until we unearth a top spinner. I still hope Kerrigan will develop into that in due course!

DreamCricketer: First of all well played England Team! Sri Lanka did not get it from the first ball. They had just little over 6 per over and they were all over the place.

@CodandChips - I agree Bopara has improved in recent times and indeed I look on him as a front line white ball who can hit a ball in the lower order but with the emergence of Jordan and Gurney, I'd prefer to have them in the side. Where I'd disagree with you is that Bopara hasn't, in my view, won many matches with his late order hitting (though I agree the top order don't score quickly enough and leave too much for the middle/late order to do) and usually he smacks a few boundaries at the death in a losing cause. It will be interesting to see if he bowls his full quota today as his batting alone isn't good enough to keep him in the side.

@FreddyForPrimeMinister I've changed my tune re Bopara. My attitude was that he could nedver get England over the line. Now he has started to. Also I thought he played the big innings less times than he played the absolutely abysmal innings. That tide is turning too. Also he has probably been the side's best white-ball bowler recently (suppose that says more about the other bowlers such as Bresnan, Dernbach and Rankin). Also Bopara has on occasion been left too much to do. 
 
 
Agree Woakes has an excellent first class record but is that worthy of an ODI place? Perhaps a test place ahead of Stokes. But Woakes has put on some pace so might be improved.
 
 
I'm not too convinced about Ali. His England time with the bat was disappointing, though he was underuesd with the ball. 
 
 
Also Tredwell's record is outstanding, though it has concerned me that when teams commit to going after him he just goes, as he did at home vs Australia.

@CodandChips - agree with most of your comments and it's disappointing Taylor isn't even in the squad. With what we have however, I'd swop Tredwell and Bopara for Ali and Woakes, switching Root to 3 and Ballance to 4 or even 5 after Morgan. Ali and Root can share Tredwell's overs and I'm keen to give Woakes an extended run in the side, especially in Test and ODI games. His FC record over the last 3-4 years is streets ahead of any other all-rounder. Bopara is rapidly making a name for hitting a few late lusty blows in a losing cause - unlike Dhoni however, he never actually seems to win the game for us!

Just thinking if Bopara was struggling why not give Woakes a game? Surely the whole point of a series where you're trying to find your best side is that you give everyone a go?
 
 
Meanwhile England have struggled in the Powerplay as expected. But not only have we got hardly any runs but we've lost a wicket. Sri Lanka are bowling well and the conditions are good for bowling, but surely if we're gonna lose wickets we could do so while trying to score runs.

Carberry or Ballance probably won't make much difference as both have looked very uncomfortable when playing for England.

I'm still not too convinced we need both Cook and Bell at the top. In English conditions we probably need 1, though James Taylor or Joe Root in the top order could surely add the needed stability, but have the potential for fireworks at the end. Same with Lumb who is really hard-done by, given he got a hundred on debut, can bat through or play shots. He is far more than just the slogger people think he is. Hales should get a go in Australian conditions, but maybe not in England. If he did play I would want him to play as he does in T20s. His T20I average of over 35 is better than many in ODIs, and he'd enjoy the longer powerplay and more overs against seam.

I've been following England since 1981, and watched the build to every World Cup since then.  England have NEVER had a settled ODI team.

Harry Gurney is a fine example - good player as he is, WHY is he even being mentioned for the World Cup?  Mind you, I'd rather see the words Harry Gurney than Jade Dernbach!  Good luck England.

@Kavindu Darshana,  Don't worry, Kusal will play forever, since he has a MARVELOUS RECORD outside Bangladesh (BATTING AVERAGE 14.2 from 21 ODIs & Average of 2.8 in ENg/Ireland). Kusal opened the GOLDEN GATE (for other top-order batsmen to carry the burden) within the first 5 overs, 12 times in 19 innings that he opened, since June 2013 (within 3 overs in all 9 consecutive 50over/T20 innings that he opened in Eng/Ireland - record:( 0R-01B, 4R- 2B, 1R-3B, 0R-4B, 6R-10B, 4R-10B, 10R- 10B)!
Way to GO... KEEP it Up SL... Drop Chandimal or anyone to Keep our super Hero Kusal!

It seems to be some people who has commented here don't have an idea of Sri Lankans squad as they have mentioned K Vithanage. HE IS NOT IN THE SQUAD. My playing side is (should be)
1 Kusal Perera, 2 Tillakaratne Dilshan, 3 Kumar Sangakkara (wk), 4 Mahela Jayawardene, 5 Lahiru Thirimanne, 6 D Chandimal, 7 Angelo Mathews (capt), 8 Thisara Perera, 9 Nuwan Kulasekara, 10 Sachithra Senanayake, 11 Lasith Malinga 
England have done a big mistake in not picking Hales. At the moment London's sky is little bit gloomy and hope there will be some sunshine later of the day. Good luck to the both teams and hoping SL's eventual victory.

I don't think that probable XI is right for SL. I believe Chandimal and Herath will play instead of Sachi and Mendis. The Oval doesn't turn like it did in the 90s/00s.  SL will pack the batting to score 300+ and use  Malinga, Kula, Mathews, and TP. With Dilshan and Thiri also chipping in

What rubbish ""agricultural"" about Thisara Perera. Is that why he has been bought by an IPL franchise too. He is effective and he is a good 20x20 and ODI player. How about Butler who goes for scoope, ramp shots. He is effective too.
 
 
SL have a very formidable team. Only thing they have against them is the UK unpredictable weather. Get the sun on their backs and they start to play excellent cricket. SL have won more ICC trophies than most . So do not rubbish them.

No need to drop Kushal Perera as SL badly need that explosive start and we all know Dilshan is not the explosive batsman he once was... So we need Kushal to get that start.... Dont forget how Sanath blasted English bowling in 2006.... Also Kushal is very young and inexperienced.... So give him some time....

I hope England do something they don't usually do in making sure everybody gets a game (maybe not Bresnan).

Perhaps England should select smaller squads in home series to minimise damage to both players and counties.

The issue of preparing for a world cup which is away is that the conditions are so different. As Strauss said in his autobiography, ODI cricket in England is completely different to the rest of the world, like a totally different format because of the conditions. Maybe we should treat it as a different format in both personnel and approach.

With the top 4 being 1 Alastair Cook, 2 Ian Bell, 3 Michael Carberry, 4 Joe Root I dont see the Brits making use of the first 15. They are leaving all too late. Butler is not good behind the stumps - Solution: Bring in Kieswetter play him at 7, Let Butler open the innings and free his arms, he might even learn how to build an innings, its worth the investment to try it out. Im sure he'd be a world class player then, rather than bit and pieces player now.
Root Just rolls his arm, NOT a bowler. 50 over games hes gonna leak runs. Tredwell needs a good parnter. Moin is going to be a good foil for him, LHB and RHB in tandem. Also Moin brings a new dimension to the top order. Carberry is expired berry if the WC is the focus, we are wasting time.
Who plays 50 overs games with only 2 specialist bowlers? the two Chriss' are all rounders who havent proven themselves yet, so why play both on the same game? At best they will contain,  wickets will come only if they are lucky.

@Prageeth Anjula: You are right... Chandi has no place, when Kusal plays. But Why only Kusal ? What about Bhanuka Rajapakshe, Rambukwella & even Mubarak ? In my honest opinion, they all should be in the playing 11 to make a Real-Difference in SL cricket and lift the standard to a sky high level. Thanks to the SLC 's most valuable regeneration program, we can see a Glowing Bright Future for SL cricket, when all this is fulfilled in very near future. The only problem is, this cannot be applied to the bowlers, since they are a rare bread, that even a lookalike cannot be found within the sacred territory. Otherwise, by now, we would have seen another set of juggernauts replacing the bowlers like Malinga, Kulasekera, Lakmal etc. This could have added more Glory to the glistening futur of SL cricket..

But unfortunately some one allocate thirimanna in the middle order with destroying middle order future players . It is a very negative tactic . While negative batting of thirimanna , some one should have to score in the rate to win (perera does this days) .  If management encourage to bat in the style of thirimanna a SL U19 player will fill that role . If   Chandimal , Vithanage and priyanjan is taken care as thirimanna those 3 will pass don bradman

The series should be interesting and good to follow. For Eng fans, the whole 'New Era' is media generated cotswoddle, basically it is  a label attached to make something more attractive, like steve waugh calling the 2001 tour of india 'the final frontier' although in a different context and meaning and his intention was not to capture eyeballs with that comment. Any ways, any fan buying into  the whole hoopla of 'new era' is misled, basically no single team or their followers of ANY sport has a monopoly on the no 1 position or to win every time they set foot on the field, all that talk about claiming what is 'rightfully theirs' is again media twaddle bordering on arrogance. England are a good side and should perform well in their home summer, donot know about SL but India with their pop-gun pathetic pace atack should be easy pushovers, the question is if they can sustain it when touring SA, Aus, India etc. I request cricinfo to publish this....

With new odi rules, specially with only four fielders in the outer ring at the back end of an inning, odi cricket doesn't require openers with strike rates of 100 along with an average of 10-20 any more, unlike in the past. The strategy should be to keep wickets in hand while going around 5 runs per over until 30-35 th over and the try to accelerate the in the remaining overs. You can simply double, whatever the score you got by 30th over in the remaining 20 overs if you have enough wickets. ....... On this basis I prefer Thiri opening with Dili allowing Chandi to be in XI. ..... Anyway Best of Luck SL ....... !

You kidding me? One of our best batsmen in these conditions, Chandimal, will make way for someone else???

He should definitely play, especially if SLC are thinking that Thirimanne and Chandimal are the future.

I just cannot believe some of you are still talking about Chandimal being in the side, he has been a constant failure for the past 2 years (bar a couple of good innings)   he failed  rather miserably at the Aisa cup & the T20 world cup and again yesterday.This  just proves he may be ok for 1st class cricket, but fails miserably at International level. He needs to be out of the squad and someone new has to be given a chance, otherwise we will pay for this later, e.g. SL persisted with Chamara Silva and Mubarak whilst depriving more deserving candidates resulting in us having a brittle lower middle order for many years, and we are just recovering from those decisions.

Pity James Taylor won't be playing - he's a class act who needs to be told he's going to be a big part of England's plans going forward. For the same reason I hope Woakes plays - what more do his stats have to do to convince the selectors he's the best all-rounder we've had potentially since Freddy. Ok, he's not express pace, but neither was McGrath, Pollock, Hadlee, Vaas - nor indeed Anderson and Zaheer Khan - all pretty useful bowlers! The lad bowls tightly, gets wickets and though perhaps not yet in form this season, scores runs. Like Taylor, he needs an arm round the shoulder and to be told he can form the bedrock of the side over the next 10 years. I'm afraid Carberry isn't the answer and the jury is still out on Bell's strike rate. Moeen Ali and Root should form our spin options until a class spinner (Kerrigan?) really puts his hand up. That way we have room for the extra pace bowler in Gurney.
